00:00:44,353 --> 00:00:46,328  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:374 Y2:410
There's an old joke.

3
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:49,249  X1:182 X2:540 Y1:334 Y2:409
Two elderly women are
at a Catskill mountain resort.

4
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:52,447  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
One says, "The food at this place
is really terrible."

5
00:00:52,515 --> 00:00:55,385  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
The other says,
"l know, and such small portions."

6
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,308  X1:237 X2:485 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's essentially
how l feel about life:

7
00:00:58,372 --> 00:01:01,952  X1:187 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
full of loneliness, misery,
suffering and unhappiness...

8
00:01:02,022 --> 00:01:05,056  X1:257 X2:465 Y1:334 Y2:409
and it's all over
much too quickly.

9
00:01:05,127 --> 00:01:07,778  X1:153 X2:568 Y1:374 Y2:410
The other important joke for me...

10
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:10,434  X1:214 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
is one usually attributed
to Groucho Marx...

11
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:14,214  X1:123 X2:599 Y1:334 Y2:409
but it appears originally in Freud's
Wit and lts Relation to the Unconscious.

12
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:16,421  X1:157 X2:564 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt goes like this, l'm paraphrasing:

13
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,681  X1:100 X2:621 Y1:334 Y2:409
l never want to belong to any club that
would have someone like me for a member.

14
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:25,418  X1:111 X2:611 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's the key joke of my adult life
in terms of my relationships with women.

15
00:01:25,484 --> 00:01:28,551  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
Lately the strangest things
have been going through my mind...

16
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:32,102  X1:166 X2:556 Y1:334 Y2:409
because l turned 40, and l guess
l'm going through a life crisis.

17
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:34,793  X1:166 X2:556 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm not worried about aging.
l'm not one of those characters.

18
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:38,311  X1:125 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
But l'm balding slightly on top. That's
about the worst you can say about me.

19
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:41,581  X1:186 X2:536 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think l'm going to get better
as l get older.

20
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:44,496  X1:217 X2:505 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think l'm going to be
the balding, virile type...

21
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:48,239  X1:133 X2:589 Y1:374 Y2:410
as opposed to the distinguished gray.

22
00:01:48,306 --> 00:01:50,216  X1:170 X2:552 Y1:374 Y2:410
Unless l'm neither of those two.

23
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,680  X1:122 X2:600 Y1:334 Y2:409
Unless l'm one of those guys with saliva
dribbling out of his mouth...

24
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:57,197  X1:107 X2:614 Y1:334 Y2:409
who wanders into a cafeteria with a
shopping bag, screaming about socialism.

25
00:01:58,133 --> 00:02:01,647  X1:175 X2:546 Y1:334 Y2:409
Annie and l broke up, and l still
can't get my mind around that.

26
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:05,134  X1:135 X2:586 Y1:334 Y2:409
l keep sifting the pieces
of the relationship through my mind...

27
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:09,878  X1:119 X2:603 Y1:334 Y2:409
examining my life and trying to
figure out where did the screwup come.

28
00:02:09,944 --> 00:02:12,759  X1:194 X2:528 Y1:374 Y2:410
A year ago we were in love.

29
00:02:14,297 --> 00:02:17,811  X1:164 X2:557 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's funny. l'm not a morose type.
l'm not a depressive character.

30
00:02:19,163 --> 00:02:21,465  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:374 Y2:410
l was a reasonably happy kid.

31
00:02:21,531 --> 00:02:24,434  X1:191 X2:530 Y1:334 Y2:409
l was brought up in Brooklyn
during World War ll.

32
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:27,798  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:374 Y2:410
He's been depressed.

33
00:02:27,869 --> 00:02:30,204  X1:168 X2:554 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Suddenly he can't do anything.
- Why are you depressed, Alvy?

34
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,133  X1:223 X2:499 Y1:334 Y2:409
Tell Dr. Flicker.
lt's something he read.

35
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:36,116  X1:211 X2:511 Y1:374 Y2:410
Something he read, huh?

36
00:02:36,191 --> 00:02:40,284  X1:188 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
- The universe is expanding.
- The universe is expanding?

37
00:02:40,353 --> 00:02:43,037  X1:197 X2:524 Y1:334 Y2:409
The universe is everything,
and if it's expanding...

38
00:02:43,105 --> 00:02:46,816  X1:131 X2:590 Y1:334 Y2:409
someday it will break apart,
and that will be the end of everything.

39
00:02:46,882 --> 00:02:51,105  X1:165 X2:556 Y1:334 Y2:409
What is that your business?
He stopped doing his homework!

40
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:54,522  X1:124 X2:598 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What's the point?
- What's the universe got to do with it?

41
00:02:54,596 --> 00:02:57,826  X1:203 X2:519 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're here in Brooklyn.
Brooklyn is not expanding!

42
00:02:57,893 --> 00:03:01,724  X1:231 X2:491 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt won't be expanding
for billions of years!

43
00:03:01,798 --> 00:03:06,534  X1:137 X2:585 Y1:334 Y2:409
We've got to try and enjoy ourselves
while we're here! Huh?

44
00:03:12,137 --> 00:03:14,342  X1:179 X2:543 Y1:334 Y2:409
My analyst says l exaggerate
my childhood memories...

45
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,777  X1:168 X2:554 Y1:334 Y2:409
but l swear l was brought up
underneath the roller coaster...

46
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:18,948  X1:198 X2:524 Y1:334 Y2:409
in the Coney lsland section
of Brooklyn.

47
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:23,144  X1:109 X2:612 Y1:334 Y2:409
Maybe that accounts for my personality,
which is a little nervous.

48
00:03:23,212 --> 00:03:27,753  X1:132 X2:589 Y1:334 Y2:409
l have a hyperactive imagination.
My mind tends to jump around a little.

49
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:31,138  X1:180 X2:542 Y1:334 Y2:409
l have some trouble
between fantasy and reality.

50
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:34,316  X1:188 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
My father ran
the bumper-car concession.

51
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:36,970  X1:197 X2:525 Y1:374 Y2:410
There he is, and there l am.

52
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,357  X1:168 X2:554 Y1:334 Y2:409
l used to get my aggression out
through those cars.

53
00:03:42,577 --> 00:03:45,033  X1:227 X2:494 Y1:334 Y2:409
l remember the staff
at our public school.

54
00:03:45,105 --> 00:03:48,303  X1:186 X2:536 Y1:334 Y2:409
We had a saying,
"Those who can't do, teach...

55
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:51,503  X1:194 X2:527 Y1:334 Y2:409
and those who can't teach,
teach gym."

56
00:03:51,571 --> 00:03:55,795  X1:143 X2:579 Y1:334 Y2:409
And those who couldn't do anything,
l think, were assigned to our school.

57
00:03:58,453 --> 00:04:01,007  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
l must say, l always thought
my schoolmates were idiots.

58
00:04:01,078 --> 00:04:03,893  X1:226 X2:496 Y1:334 Y2:409
Melvyn Greenglass
and his fat little face.

59
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,993  X1:206 X2:515 Y1:334 Y2:409
And Henrietta Farrell,
Miss Perfect all the time.

60
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:10,512  X1:145 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
And lvan Ackerman,
always the wrong answer. Always!

61
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,440  X1:218 X2:503 Y1:374 Y2:410
Seven and three is nine.

62
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,609  X1:230 X2:492 Y1:334 Y2:409
Even then l knew
they were just jerks.

63
00:04:15,674 --> 00:04:19,024  X1:112 X2:610 Y1:374 Y2:410
ln 1942 l had already discovered women.

64
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:24,338  X1:279 X2:443 Y1:374 Y2:410
He kissed me!

65
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:26,780  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's the second time this month!
Step up here.

66
00:04:26,845 --> 00:04:28,755  X1:267 X2:455 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What did l do?
- Step up here.

67
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:31,318  X1:136 X2:585 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What did l do?
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

68
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:34,206  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:334 Y2:409
Why? l was just expressing
a healthy sexual curiosity.

69
00:04:34,272 --> 00:04:37,589  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:334 Y2:409
Six-year-old boys
don't have girls on their minds.

70
00:04:37,664 --> 00:04:38,776  X1:333 X2:388 Y1:374 Y2:410
l did.

71
00:04:38,848 --> 00:04:42,591  X1:167 X2:555 Y1:334 Y2:409
For God sakes, Alvy, even Freud
speaks of a latency period!

72
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:45,692  X1:190 X2:531 Y1:334 Y2:409
l never had a latency period.
l can't help it.

73
00:04:45,762 --> 00:04:47,999  X1:188 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
Why couldn't you
have been more like Donald?

74
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:50,337  X1:218 X2:503 Y1:374 Y2:410
There was a model boy.

75
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:52,673  X1:184 X2:538 Y1:334 Y2:409
Tell the folks
where you are today, Donald.

76
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,123  X1:159 X2:562 Y1:374 Y2:410
l run a profitable dress company.

77
00:04:56,197 --> 00:05:01,77  X1:193 X2:529 Y1:334 Y2:409
Sometimes l wonder where
my classmates are today.

78
00:05:01,84 --> 00:05:03,557  X1:160 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm president
of the Pinkus Plumbing Company.

79
00:05:04,455 --> 00:05:06,278  X1:285 X2:436 Y1:374 Y2:410
l sell talliths.

80
00:05:06,344 --> 00:05:10,982  X1:188 X2:533 Y1:334 Y2:409
l used to be a heroin addict,
now l'm a methadone addict.

81
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:14,214  X1:266 X2:455 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm into leather.

82
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:18,688  X1:112 X2:609 Y1:334 Y2:409
l lost track of most of my old
schoolmates, but l wound up a comedian.

83
00:05:18,763 --> 00:05:21,666  X1:162 X2:560 Y1:374 Y2:410
They did not take me in the army.

84
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,293  X1:300 X2:422 Y1:374 Y2:410
l was 4-P.

85
00:05:24,364 --> 00:05:27,813  X1:241 X2:481 Y1:334 Y2:409
ln the event of war,
l'm a hostage.

86
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:32,622  X1:171 X2:550 Y1:334 Y2:409
You always only saw the worst
in people.

87
00:05:32,687 --> 00:05:35,623  X1:204 X2:518 Y1:334 Y2:409
You never could get along
with anyone in school.

88
00:05:35,695 --> 00:05:37,998  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
You were always out of step
with the world.

89
00:05:38,064 --> 00:05:40,880  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:334 Y2:409
Even when you got famous,
you still distrusted the world.

90
00:05:40,945 --> 00:05:44,459  X1:137 X2:584 Y1:334 Y2:409
l distinctly heard it.
He muttered under his breath, "Jew."

91
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,385  X1:271 X2:451 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You're crazy.
- No, l'm not.

92
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,484  X1:130 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
We were walking off the tennis court.
He was there and me and his wife.

93
00:05:49,555 --> 00:05:51,498  X1:183 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
He looked her,
then they both looked at me...

94
00:05:51,572 --> 00:05:53,645  X1:236 X2:486 Y1:334 Y2:409
and under his breath
he said, "Jew."

95
00:05:53,717 --> 00:05:55,605  X1:216 X2:506 Y1:374 Y2:410
You're a total paranoid.

96
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:58,452  X1:170 X2:552 Y1:334 Y2:409
How am l a paranoid?
l pick up on those kind of things.

97
00:05:58,518 --> 00:06:02,960  X1:124 X2:597 Y1:334 Y2:409
l was having lunch with guys from NBC,
so l said, "Did you eat yet?"

98
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:07,472  X1:182 X2:540 Y1:334 Y2:409
Tom Christie said, "No. Jew?"
Not "Did you?"

99
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:10,676  X1:156 X2:566 Y1:334 Y2:409
Not "Did you eat?" but "Jew eat?"
You get it?

100
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,266  X1:229 X2:492 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Max--
- Stop calling me Max.

101
00:06:13,337 --> 00:06:16,917  X1:118 X2:604 Y1:334 Y2:409
Why? lt's a good name for you.
Max, you see conspiracies in everything.

102
00:06:16,987 --> 00:06:19,409  X1:157 X2:564 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, l don't. l was in a record store.
Listen to this.

103
00:06:19,484 --> 00:06:24,853  X1:122 X2:599 Y1:334 Y2:409
There's this tall, blond crew-cutted guy
and he's looking at me in a funny way.

104
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:27,708  X1:162 X2:560 Y1:334 Y2:409
He's saying, "Yes, we have a sale
this week on Wagner."

105
00:06:27,774 --> 00:06:30,906  X1:159 X2:563 Y1:334 Y2:409
Wagner, Max.
l know what he's trying to tell me.

106
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,364  X1:194 X2:528 Y1:374 Y2:410
Very significantly, Wagner.

107
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,856  X1:195 X2:527 Y1:374 Y2:410
Right, Max. California, Max.

108
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,864  X1:151 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Get the hell out of this crazy city.
- Forget it.

109
00:06:39,937 --> 00:06:42,807  X1:161 X2:560 Y1:334 Y2:409
We move to sunny L.A.
All of show business is out there.

110
00:06:42,882 --> 00:06:45,600  X1:169 X2:553 Y1:334 Y2:409
You keep bringing it up,
but l don't want to live in a city...

111
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:49,629  X1:115 X2:607 Y1:334 Y2:409
where the only cultural advantage is you
can make a right turn on a red light.

112
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,570  X1:145 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
All right, forget it. Aren't you
going to be late for meeting Annie?

113
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:55,329  X1:117 X2:604 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm meeting her in front of the Beekman.
l have a few minutes left, right?

114
00:07:11,657 --> 00:07:13,600  X1:225 X2:496 Y1:374 Y2:410
Are you on television?

115
00:07:18,027 --> 00:07:19,620  X1:244 X2:477 Y1:374 Y2:410
Yeah, occasionally.

116
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:21,317  X1:242 X2:479 Y1:374 Y2:410
What's your name?

117
00:07:21,388 --> 00:07:23,244  X1:232 X2:489 Y1:334 Y2:409
You wouldn't know it.
lt doesn't matter.

118
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:27,172  X1:166 X2:556 Y1:374 Y2:410
You're on Johnny Carson, right?

119
00:07:28,174 --> 00:07:29,866  X1:269 X2:453 Y1:374 Y2:410
Once in a while.

120
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:32,357  X1:242 X2:479 Y1:374 Y2:410
What's your name?

121
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:35,661  X1:232 X2:489 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm Robert Redford.
- Come on!

122
00:07:36,688 --> 00:07:39,755  X1:156 X2:566 Y1:334 Y2:409
Alvy Singer.
Thanks very much for everything.

123
00:07:42,737 --> 00:07:44,680  X1:247 X2:474 Y1:374 Y2:410
This is Alvy Singer!

124
00:07:46,803 --> 00:07:49,771  X1:176 X2:546 Y1:334 Y2:409
This guy's on television.
Alvy Singer, right? Am l right?

125
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,081  X1:211 X2:511 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Give me a break.
- This guy's on television.

126
00:07:52,148 --> 00:07:54,004  X1:194 X2:527 Y1:374 Y2:410
l need the large polo mallet.

127
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:57,266  X1:130 X2:592 Y1:334 Y2:409
-Who's on television?
-This guy, on the Johnny Carson Show.

128
00:07:57,334 --> 00:08:00,783  X1:136 X2:585 Y1:334 Y2:409
- ls this a meeting of the teamsters?
- What program?

129
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,743  X1:169 X2:553 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Can l have your autograph?
- You don't want my autograph.

130
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:05,623  X1:208 X2:514 Y1:374 Y2:410
l do! lt's for my girlfriend.

131
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:07,630  X1:237 X2:485 Y1:374 Y2:410
Make it out to Ralph.

132
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:11,153  X1:158 X2:564 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Your girlfriend's name is Ralph?
- lt's for my brother.

133
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,883  X1:207 X2:514 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're really Alvy Singer,
the TV star?

134
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:21,746  X1:218 X2:504 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Alvy Singer over here!
- lt's all right, fellas.

135
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,407  X1:140 X2:582 Y1:334 Y2:409
Jesus, what did you do?
Come by way of the Panama Canal?

136
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,577  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:334 Y2:409
-l'm in a bad mood.
-l'm here with the Godfather cast.

137
00:08:27,646 --> 00:08:31,608  X1:108 X2:613 Y1:334 Y2:409
-Learn to deal with it.
-l'm dealing with two guys named Cheech.

138
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:34,167  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:374 Y2:410
Please, l have a headache.

139
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:37,175  X1:162 X2:559 Y1:334 Y2:409
You are in a bad mood.
You must be getting your period.

140
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:39,159  X1:165 X2:556 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm not getting my period! Jesus!

141
00:08:39,234 --> 00:08:42,169  X1:121 X2:600 Y1:334 Y2:409
Every time anything out of the ordinary
happens, you think l have my period.

142
00:08:42,242 --> 00:08:44,861  X1:190 X2:531 Y1:334 Y2:409
A little louder. l think one
of them may have missed it.

143
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:47,998  X1:200 X2:522 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Has the picture started?
- Two minutes ago.

144
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:50,173  X1:247 X2:474 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's it. Forget it.
l can't go in.

145
00:08:50,244 --> 00:08:53,027  X1:212 X2:510 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Two minutes.
- We've blown it already.

146
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:55,395  X1:209 X2:513 Y1:374 Y2:410
l can't go in, in the middle.

147
00:08:55,462 --> 00:08:58,278  X1:164 X2:558 Y1:334 Y2:409
ln the middle? We've only missed
the titles. They're in Swedish.

148
00:08:58,343 --> 00:09:00,198  X1:120 X2:601 Y1:374 Y2:410
You want to get coffee for two hours?

149
00:09:00,263 --> 00:09:03,395  X1:187 X2:535 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Two hours? No. l'm going in.
- Go ahead. Good-bye.

150
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:06,082  X1:242 X2:480 Y1:334 Y2:409
While we're talking,
we could be inside.

151
00:09:06,152 --> 00:09:09,896  X1:111 X2:611 Y1:334 Y2:409
Can we not argue in front of everybody?
l get embarrassed.

152
00:09:09,962 --> 00:09:14,436  X1:130 X2:592 Y1:334 Y2:409
- All right. So what do you want to do?
- l don't know. Go to another movie?

153
00:09:14,507 --> 00:09:16,679  X1:148 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
-Let's see The Sorrow and the Pity.
-We've seen it.

154
00:09:16,747 --> 00:09:19,715  X1:151 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm not in the mood to see
a four hour documentary on Nazis.

155
00:09:19,788 --> 00:09:21,731  X1:304 X2:418 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm sorry.

156
00:09:21,804 --> 00:09:26,540  X1:144 X2:578 Y1:334 Y2:409
l've got to see a picture exactly
from start to finish, 'cause l'm anal.

157
00:09:26,606 --> 00:09:28,494  X1:238 X2:483 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's a polite word
for what you are.

158
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,699  X1:142 X2:579 Y1:334 Y2:409
We saw the Fellini film last Tuesday.
lt is not one of his best.

159
00:09:34,768 --> 00:09:36,744  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt lacks a cohesive structure.

160
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:40,527  X1:128 X2:594 Y1:334 Y2:409
You get the feeling he's not absolutely
sure what it is he wants to say.

161
00:09:40,594 --> 00:09:45,330  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:334 Y2:409
l've always felt he was essentially
a technical filmmaker.

162
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:48,364  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:374 Y2:410
Granted La Strada was a great film.

163
00:09:48,435 --> 00:09:51,436  X1:141 X2:581 Y1:334 Y2:409
Great in its use of negative imagery
more than anything else.

164
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:54,641  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm going to have a stroke.
- Stop listening to him.

165
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:57,908  X1:135 X2:586 Y1:374 Y2:410
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.

166
00:09:57,975 --> 00:10:01,271  X1:195 X2:527 Y1:334 Y2:409
All that Juliet of the Spirits
or Satyricon.

167
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:04,402  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:374 Y2:410
l found it incredibly indulgent.

168
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:07,539  X1:154 X2:568 Y1:334 Y2:409
He really is one of
the most indulgent of filmmakers.

169
00:10:07,609 --> 00:10:09,814  X1:187 X2:535 Y1:374 Y2:410
Key word here is "indulgent."

170
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:14,902  X1:156 X2:566 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What are you depressed about?
- l missed my therapy. l overslept.

171
00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:16,979  X1:160 X2:562 Y1:374 Y2:410
How can you possibly oversleep?

172
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:18,677  X1:262 X2:460 Y1:374 Y2:410
The alarm clock.

173
00:10:18,748 --> 00:10:20,691  X1:161 X2:560 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know what a hostile gesture
that is to me?

174
00:10:20,765 --> 00:10:23,635  X1:223 X2:499 Y1:334 Y2:409
l know. Because of our
sexual problem, right?

175
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:27,507  X1:184 X2:538 Y1:334 Y2:409
Everybody in line has to know
our rate of intercourse?

176
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,339  X1:216 X2:505 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's like Samuel Beckett.

177
00:10:29,407 --> 00:10:33,085  X1:155 X2:566 Y1:334 Y2:409
l admire the technique,
but it doesn't hit me on a gut level.

178
00:10:33,152 --> 00:10:35,804  X1:172 X2:549 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'd like to hit him on a gut level.
- Stop it.

179
00:10:35,873 --> 00:10:39,703  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:334 Y2:409
He's spitting on my neck
when he talks.

180
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:42,812  X1:195 X2:526 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know something else?
You're so egocentric that...

181
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:46,266  X1:133 X2:588 Y1:334 Y2:409
if l miss my therapy you can only think
of it in terms of how it affects you!

182
00:10:48,421 --> 00:10:50,560  X1:142 X2:580 Y1:374 Y2:410
They're probably on their first date.

183
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:54,143  X1:158 X2:564 Y1:334 Y2:409
Probably met by answering an ad
in the New York Review of Books.

184
00:10:54,214 --> 00:10:56,069  X1:211 X2:511 Y1:334 Y2:409
"Thirtyish academic
wishes to meet woman...

185
00:10:56,134 --> 00:11:01,91  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:334 Y2:409
who's interested in Mozart,
James Joyce and sodomy."

186
00:11:01,97 --> 00:11:01,831  X1:226 X2:496 Y1:334 Y2:409
What do you mean
"our sexual problem"?

187
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:04,318  X1:192 X2:530 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm comparatively normal
for a guy raised in Brooklyn.

188
00:11:04,392 --> 00:11:08,288  X1:186 X2:535 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm sorry. My sexual problem.
Okay? My sexual problem!

189
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:12,356  X1:111 X2:611 Y1:334 Y2:409
l never read that. That was Henry James'
sequel to Turn of the Screw?

190
00:11:12,427 --> 00:11:14,849  X1:178 X2:544 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's the influence of television.

191
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:20,456  X1:149 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
Marshall McLuhan deals with it
in terms of it being a high intensity.

192
00:11:20,524 --> 00:11:22,532  X1:238 X2:483 Y1:334 Y2:409
Do you understand?
A hot medium.

193
00:11:22,605 --> 00:11:26,665  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
What l wouldn't give for a large sock
with horse manure in it.

194
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:30,379  X1:148 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
What do you do when you get stuck
on a movie line with a guy like this?

195
00:11:30,448 --> 00:11:33,416  X1:157 X2:564 Y1:334 Y2:409
Wait. Why can't l give my opinion?
lt's a free country!

196
00:11:33,488 --> 00:11:35,878  X1:178 X2:543 Y1:334 Y2:409
He can.
Do you have to give it so loud?

197
00:11:35,953 --> 00:11:38,288  X1:213 X2:509 Y1:334 Y2:409
Aren't you ashamed
to pontificate like that?

198
00:11:38,354 --> 00:11:42,479  X1:155 X2:566 Y1:334 Y2:409
The funny part is, you don't know
anything about Marshall McLuhan.

199
00:11:42,547 --> 00:11:46,923  X1:134 X2:587 Y1:334 Y2:409
l happen to teach a class at Columbia
called "TV, Media and Culture."

200
00:11:46,996 --> 00:11:50,642  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think my insights into Mr. McLuhan
have a great deal of validity.

201
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:55,282  X1:121 X2:600 Y1:334 Y2:409
Do you? That's funny, because l happen
to have Mr. McLuhan right here.

202
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,766  X1:209 X2:512 Y1:334 Y2:409
Just let me--
Come over here. Tell him.

203
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:00,749  X1:180 X2:542 Y1:374 Y2:410
l heard what you were saying.

204
00:12:00,824 --> 00:12:05,135  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know nothing of my work.
You mean my whole fallacy is wrong.

205
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:08,341  X1:145 X2:576 Y1:334 Y2:409
How you ever got to teach a course
in anything is totally amazing!

206
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,931  X1:214 X2:508 Y1:374 Y2:410
lf life were only like this.

207
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:18,232  X1:155 X2:567 Y1:070 Y2:145
June 14, 1940.
The German army occupies Paris.

208
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,230  X1:169 X2:553 Y1:070 Y2:145
All over the country,
people are desperate for food.

209
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:25,750  X1:141 X2:581 Y1:334 Y2:409
Those guys in the French Resistance
were really brave.

210
00:12:25,822 --> 00:12:28,506  X1:152 X2:570 Y1:334 Y2:409
To have to listen
to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.

211
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:32,286  X1:173 X2:549 Y1:334 Y2:409
l know. Sometimes l ask myself
how l'd stand up under torture.

212
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,262  X1:248 X2:474 Y1:374 Y2:410
You? You kidding?

213
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:38,167  X1:099 X2:622 Y1:334 Y2:409
The Gestapo would take away your charge
card, and you'd tell 'em everything.

214
00:12:38,242 --> 00:12:40,185  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:374 Y2:410
That movie makes me feel guilty.

215
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,299  X1:260 X2:462 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's supposed to.

216
00:12:43,523 --> 00:12:46,207  X1:304 X2:417 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Alvy, l--
- What?

217
00:12:46,276 --> 00:12:48,481  X1:238 X2:483 Y1:374 Y2:410
What's the matter?

218
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,259  X1:161 X2:560 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's not natural.
We're sleeping in a bed together.

219
00:12:52,326 --> 00:12:54,181  X1:237 X2:484 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's been a long time!

220
00:12:54,246 --> 00:12:56,614  X1:257 X2:464 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's just, l mean--

221
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,233  X1:169 X2:552 Y1:334 Y2:409
l've got to sing tomorrow night,
so l have to rest my voice.

222
00:12:59,304 --> 00:13:02,436  X1:149 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's always some kind of an excuse.
You used to think l was very sexy.

223
00:13:02,504 --> 00:13:05,123  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
When we first started going out,
we had sex constantly.

224
00:13:05,193 --> 00:13:07,714  X1:142 X2:579 Y1:334 Y2:409
We're probably listed in
The Guiness Book of World Records.

225
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:11,496  X1:198 X2:523 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt'll pass. l'm going
through a phase, that's all.

226
00:13:11,562 --> 00:13:13,952  X1:181 X2:540 Y1:334 Y2:409
You've been married before.
You know how things can get.

227
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:16,635  X1:245 X2:476 Y1:334 Y2:409
You were very hot
for Allison at first.

228
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:24,505  X1:120 X2:601 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know that you're on right
after Chris Brown, in about 20 minutes.

229
00:13:24,573 --> 00:13:26,483  X1:260 X2:462 Y1:334 Y2:409
Excuse me.
When do l go on?

230
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:28,468  X1:277 X2:445 Y1:374 Y2:410
Who are you?

231
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:30,878  X1:287 X2:434 Y1:374 Y2:410
Alvy Singer.

232
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,497  X1:248 X2:474 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm the comedian.
- Oh, comedian.

233
00:13:33,568 --> 00:13:36,286  X1:249 X2:472 Y1:374 Y2:410
Oh, you're on next.

234
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:38,393  X1:201 X2:521 Y1:374 Y2:410
What do you mean "next"?

235
00:13:38,465 --> 00:13:40,506  X1:181 X2:540 Y1:374 Y2:410
You're on right after this act.

236
00:13:40,578 --> 00:13:43,197  X1:156 X2:566 Y1:334 Y2:409
- lt can't be, because he's a comic.
- Yes.

237
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:46,562  X1:117 X2:605 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You're putting on two comics in a row?
- Why not?

238
00:13:46,628 --> 00:13:49,858  X1:152 X2:570 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, l'm sorry. l'm not going to go on
after another comedian.

239
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:54,116  X1:142 X2:579 Y1:334 Y2:409
- lt's okay.
- No. They're laughing. l'd rather not.

240
00:13:54,181 --> 00:13:56,549  X1:207 X2:515 Y1:334 Y2:409
Will you relax, please?
They're going to love you.

241
00:13:56,614 --> 00:14:01,55  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
l know. l prefer not to.
Look, they're laughing at him.

242
00:14:01,62 --> 00:14:01,795  X1:153 X2:568 Y1:334 Y2:409
What are you telling me?
They'll laugh at him a few minutes.

243
00:14:01,863 --> 00:14:04,799  X1:170 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
Then l've got to get laughs, too.
How much can they laugh?

244
00:14:04,873 --> 00:14:07,524  X1:227 X2:495 Y1:334 Y2:409
- They're laughed out.
- Do you feel all right?

245
00:14:07,593 --> 00:14:09,634  X1:321 X2:400 Y1:374 Y2:410
Jesus.

246
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:13,482  X1:234 X2:487 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What's your name?
- Allison.

247
00:14:13,547 --> 00:14:15,914  X1:234 X2:488 Y1:374 Y2:410
Yeah? Allison what?

248
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:17,987  X1:298 X2:423 Y1:374 Y2:410
Portchnik.

249
00:14:18,348 --> 00:14:21,927  X1:213 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Portchnik? That's nice.
- Thank you.

250
00:14:24,814 --> 00:14:28,612  X1:192 X2:529 Y1:334 Y2:409
So, you work for Stevenson
all the time?

251
00:14:28,687 --> 00:14:32,617  X1:214 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
- No. l'm doing my thesis.
- On what?

252
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:35,723  X1:199 X2:523 Y1:334 Y2:409
Political commitment
in 20th-century literature.

253
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:39,023  X1:186 X2:535 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're like New York Jewish,
left-wing, intellectual...

254
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:42,222  X1:118 X2:603 Y1:334 Y2:409
Central Park West, Brandeis University,
socialist summer camps...

255
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:45,325  X1:176 X2:545 Y1:334 Y2:409
and the father
with the Ben Shahn drawings...

256
00:14:45,395 --> 00:14:48,396  X1:218 X2:504 Y1:374 Y2:410
really strike-oriented--

257
00:14:48,468 --> 00:14:50,738  X1:175 X2:547 Y1:334 Y2:409
Stop me before l make
a complete imbecile of myself.

258
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:55,061  X1:112 X2:610 Y1:334 Y2:409
That was wonderful! l love being reduced
to a cultural stereotype.

259
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:58,477  X1:256 X2:465 Y1:334 Y2:409
Right. l'm a bigot,
but for the left.

260
00:15:00,439 --> 00:15:04,335  X1:141 X2:581 Y1:334 Y2:409
l have to go out there.
Say something encouraging, quickly.

261
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:07,923  X1:243 X2:479 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l think you're cute.
- Yeah? Do you?

262
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:10,099  X1:299 X2:422 Y1:374 Y2:410
Go ahead.

263
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:23,292  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know why they would have me
at this kind of rally...

264
00:15:23,358 --> 00:15:26,904  X1:209 X2:512 Y1:334 Y2:409
'cause l'm not essentially
a political comedian.

265
00:15:26,974 --> 00:15:31,449  X1:146 X2:576 Y1:374 Y2:410
l interestingly had dated a woman...

266
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,488  X1:157 X2:564 Y1:334 Y2:409
in the Eisenhower administration,
briefly.

267
00:15:34,561 --> 00:15:37,212  X1:240 X2:481 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt was ironic to me...

268
00:15:38,466 --> 00:15:41,117  X1:165 X2:556 Y1:374 Y2:410
'cause l was trying to do to her...

269
00:15:41,186 --> 00:15:44,187  X1:126 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
what Eisenhower's been doing
to the country for the last eight years.

270
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:50,173  X1:196 X2:525 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm sorry.
l can't go through with this.

271
00:15:50,245 --> 00:15:53,562  X1:209 X2:512 Y1:334 Y2:409
l can't get it off my mind!
lt's obsessing me!

272
00:15:53,638 --> 00:15:56,486  X1:231 X2:491 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm getting tired of it.
l need your attention.

273
00:15:56,551 --> 00:16:00,512  X1:141 X2:581 Y1:334 Y2:409
But it doesn't make any sense.
He drove past the book depository...

274
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,683  X1:172 X2:550 Y1:334 Y2:409
and the police said conclusively
that it was an exit wound.

275
00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:07,944  X1:120 X2:602 Y1:334 Y2:409
So how is it possible for Oswald
to have fired from two angles at once?

276
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,985  X1:225 X2:496 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt doesn't make sense!

277
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:14,528  X1:170 X2:552 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'll tell you this.
He was not marksman enough...

278
00:16:14,604 --> 00:16:16,993  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:374 Y2:410
to hit a moving target at that range.

279
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:21,379  X1:137 X2:584 Y1:374 Y2:410
But if there was a second assassin--

280
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:23,909  X1:203 X2:519 Y1:334 Y2:409
- That's it!
- We've been through this.

281
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:26,438  X1:204 X2:518 Y1:334 Y2:409
They recovered the shells
from that rifle.

282
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,453  X1:200 X2:522 Y1:374 Y2:410
What are you saying now?

283
00:16:28,527 --> 00:16:32,805  X1:098 X2:623 Y1:334 Y2:409
That everybody on the Warren Commission
is in on this conspiracy, right?

284
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,474  X1:302 X2:419 Y1:374 Y2:410
Why not?

285
00:16:34,545 --> 00:16:38,539  X1:158 X2:563 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Earl Warren?
- Honey, l don't know Earl Warren.

286
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,498  X1:256 X2:466 Y1:374 Y2:410
Lyndon Johnson?

287
00:16:40,562 --> 00:16:42,832  X1:180 X2:541 Y1:374 Y2:410
Lyndon Johnson is a politician!

288
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:47,308  X1:129 X2:592 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know the ethics those guys have.
lt's a notch underneath child molester.

289
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,715  X1:127 X2:594 Y1:374 Y2:410
Then everybody's in on the conspiracy.

290
00:16:49,781 --> 00:16:54,900  X1:117 X2:605 Y1:334 Y2:409
The FBl and the ClA and J. Edgar Hoover,
the oil companies...

291
00:16:54,966 --> 00:16:58,164  X1:110 X2:611 Y1:334 Y2:409
the Pentagon, the men's-room attendant
at the White House?

292
00:16:58,232 --> 00:17:01,266  X1:195 X2:526 Y1:334 Y2:409
l would leave out
the men's-room attendant.

293
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:06,487  X1:146 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're using this conspiracy theory
as an excuse to avoid sex with me.

294
00:17:06,554 --> 00:17:09,751  X1:289 X2:432 Y1:334 Y2:409
Oh, my God!
She's right.

295
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:11,924  X1:143 X2:579 Y1:374 Y2:410
Why did l turn off Allison Portchnik?

296
00:17:11,995 --> 00:17:15,793  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
She was beautiful. She was willing.
She was real intelligent.

297
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,619  X1:169 X2:553 Y1:374 Y2:410
ls it the old Groucho Marx joke...

298
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:22,483  X1:133 X2:589 Y1:334 Y2:409
that l don't want to belong to any club
that would have me for a member?

299
00:17:22,622 --> 00:17:25,972  X1:249 X2:473 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Alvy, don't panic!
- lt's a mistake...

300
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:27,902  X1:168 X2:554 Y1:374 Y2:410
to bring a live thing in the house.

301
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:29,877  X1:278 X2:444 Y1:374 Y2:410
Don't do that.

302
00:17:29,952 --> 00:17:33,335  X1:169 X2:552 Y1:334 Y2:409
Maybe we should call the police.
Dial 911. lt's the lobster squad.

303
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:35,831  X1:220 X2:502 Y1:334 Y2:409
They're only baby ones.
For God sakes.

304
00:17:35,905 --> 00:17:38,906  X1:143 X2:579 Y1:334 Y2:409
- lf they're babies, you pick them up.
- All right! All right!

305
00:17:38,979 --> 00:17:41,762  X1:240 X2:482 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Here you go!
- Don't give it to me.

306
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,992  X1:213 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
Look! One crawled
behind the refrigerator.

307
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,738  X1:171 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt'll turn up in our bed at night.
Get out of here with that thing!

308
00:17:50,342 --> 00:17:52,764  X1:239 X2:482 Y1:334 Y2:409
Talk to him.
You speak shellfish.

309
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,556  X1:236 X2:485 Y1:374 Y2:410
Hey, put it in the pot.

310
00:17:55,623 --> 00:17:59,006  X1:190 X2:531 Y1:334 Y2:409
l can't. l can't put a live thing
in hot water.

311
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,252  X1:131 X2:590 Y1:334 Y2:409
What d'you think we were going to do,
take him to the movies?

312
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,328  X1:238 X2:484 Y1:374 Y2:410
Good. Oh, thank you.

313
00:18:03,401 --> 00:18:06,271  X1:217 X2:504 Y1:334 Y2:409
Okay, it's in.
lt's definitely in the pot.

314
00:18:06,346 --> 00:18:08,997  X1:197 X2:525 Y1:334 Y2:409
Annie, there's a big lobster
behind the refrigerator.

315
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:11,882  X1:249 X2:473 Y1:334 Y2:409
l can't get it out.
This thing's heavy.

316
00:18:11,947 --> 00:18:15,690  X1:142 X2:579 Y1:334 Y2:409
Maybe if l put a dish of butter sauce
here, it'll run out the other side.

317
00:18:15,756 --> 00:18:17,612  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm going to get my camera.

318
00:18:17,677 --> 00:18:20,166  X1:237 X2:484 Y1:374 Y2:410
l think if l could pry--

319
00:18:20,237 --> 00:18:23,587  X1:131 X2:590 Y1:334 Y2:409
We should have gotten steaks, 'cause
they don't have legs and run around.

320
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:30,124  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Pick this lobster up. Hold it, please.
- You're going to take pictures now?

321
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,739  X1:222 X2:500 Y1:334 Y2:409
Alvy, it'll be wonderful.
Oh, lovely!

322
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,356  X1:174 X2:548 Y1:334 Y2:409
- lt's disgusting.
- One more, please? One more.

323
00:18:37,426 --> 00:18:38,801  X1:325 X2:397 Y1:374 Y2:410
Good!

324
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:42,184  X1:182 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
Here's what l want to know.
Am l your first, big romance?

325
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:48,522  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Who was?
- There was Dennis from high school.

326
00:18:48,597 --> 00:18:53,203  X1:126 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
Local kid who'd meet you in front
of the movie house on Saturday night?

327
00:18:53,271 --> 00:18:58,007  X1:128 X2:593 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You should've seen how l looked then.
- l can imagine. An astronaut's wife.

328
00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:00,920  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Then there was Jerry, the actor.
- Look at you.

329
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:02,840  X1:235 X2:486 Y1:374 Y2:410
You're such a clown.

330
00:19:02,905 --> 00:19:06,289  X1:127 X2:594 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l look pretty.
- You always do. But that guy with you!

331
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:10,706  X1:183 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
Acting is like an exploration
of the soul. lt's very religious.

332
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:14,162  X1:207 X2:515 Y1:334 Y2:409
Like a kind of
liberating consciousness.

333
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,408  X1:230 X2:492 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's like a visual poem.

334
00:19:16,476 --> 00:19:18,452  X1:188 X2:533 Y1:374 Y2:410
ls he kidding with that crap?

335
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,763  X1:304 X2:417 Y1:374 Y2:410
Oh, right!

336
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,147  X1:151 X2:570 Y1:334 Y2:409
Right. l think l know exactly what
you mean when you say "religious."

337
00:19:24,223 --> 00:19:26,842  X1:207 X2:515 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You do?
- Come on. l was younger.

338
00:19:26,912 --> 00:19:28,767  X1:242 X2:480 Y1:374 Y2:410
That was last year!

339
00:19:28,832 --> 00:19:31,680  X1:189 X2:532 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's like when l think of dying.
You know how l'd like to die?

340
00:19:31,745 --> 00:19:33,119  X1:325 X2:397 Y1:374 Y2:410
How?

341
00:19:33,185 --> 00:19:36,153  X1:216 X2:506 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'd like to get torn apart
by wild animals.

342
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:39,839  X1:160 X2:562 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
- He was a terrific actor.

343
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:43,105  X1:226 X2:496 Y1:334 Y2:409
He's neat looking
and he was emotional.

344
00:19:43,172 --> 00:19:45,311  X1:244 X2:478 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't think you like
emotion too much.

345
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,098  X1:173 X2:549 Y1:374 Y2:410
Touch my heart with your foot.

346
00:19:48,165 --> 00:19:49,921  X1:268 X2:454 Y1:374 Y2:410
l may throw up.

347
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,412  X1:259 X2:462 Y1:334 Y2:409
- He was creepy.
- Yeah!

348
00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:57,605  X1:155 X2:567 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You're pretty lucky l came along.
- Oh, really? La-de-dah!

349
00:19:57,672 --> 00:20:01,349  X1:193 X2:529 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf anyone ever told me
that l'd be taking out a girl...

350
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,392  X1:226 X2:496 Y1:334 Y2:409
who used expressions
like "la-de-dah"--

351
00:20:03,466 --> 00:20:06,565  X1:199 X2:522 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's right. You really like
those New York girls.

352
00:20:06,634 --> 00:20:09,897  X1:135 X2:586 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Not just. Not only.
- l'd say so. You married two of them.

353
00:20:09,963 --> 00:20:10,507  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:374 Y2:410
There's Henry Drucker.

354
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:12,450  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:374 Y2:410
There's Henry Drucker.

355
00:20:12,524 --> 00:20:14,564  X1:214 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
He has a Chair in History
at Princeton.

356
00:20:14,637 --> 00:20:18,664  X1:128 X2:594 Y1:334 Y2:409
The short man is Hershel Kaminsky.
He has a Chair in Philosophy at Cornell.

357
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:20,589  X1:199 X2:522 Y1:334 Y2:409
Two more chairs,
they got a dining room set.

358
00:20:20,655 --> 00:20:23,951  X1:151 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Why are you so hostile?
- l want to watch the Knicks on TV.

359
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,187  X1:201 X2:521 Y1:374 Y2:410
ls that Paul Goodman? No.

360
00:20:26,256 --> 00:20:29,224  X1:163 X2:559 Y1:334 Y2:409
Be nice to the host,
because he's publishing my book.

361
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:32,297  X1:260 X2:462 Y1:334 Y2:409
Hi, Doug.
Douglas Wyeth...

362
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,923  X1:187 X2:535 Y1:334 Y2:409
The Foul Rag-and-Bone Shop
of the Heart.

363
00:20:34,994 --> 00:20:36,620  X1:222 X2:500 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm so tired
of spending evenings...

364
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,633  X1:135 X2:587 Y1:334 Y2:409
making fake insights
with people who work for Dysentery.

365
00:20:38,707 --> 00:20:40,081  X1:276 X2:445 Y1:374 Y2:410
Commentary.

366
00:20:40,148 --> 00:20:43,978  X1:144 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
l heard Commentary and Dissent
had merged and formed Dysentery.

367
00:20:44,053 --> 00:20:46,988  X1:206 X2:516 Y1:334 Y2:409
No jokes.
These are friends. Okay?

368
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:50,378  X1:199 X2:522 Y1:334 Y2:409
Cleveland Cavaliers losing
to the New York Knicks.

369
00:20:50,454 --> 00:20:54,481  X1:207 X2:514 Y1:334 Y2:409
Here you are.
There's people out there.

370
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:57,235  X1:163 X2:558 Y1:334 Y2:409
Two minutes ago,
the Knicks are ahead 14 points...

371
00:20:57,304 --> 00:21:01,69  X1:151 X2:570 Y1:374 Y2:410
and now they're ahead two points.

372
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:03,474  X1:182 X2:539 Y1:374 Y2:410
Alvy, what is so fascinating...

373
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:08,217  X1:133 X2:588 Y1:334 Y2:409
about a group of pituitary cases
trying to stuff a ball through a hoop?

374
00:21:08,283 --> 00:21:10,323  X1:241 X2:481 Y1:334 Y2:409
What is fascinating
is that it's physical.

375
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,250  X1:144 X2:578 Y1:374 Y2:410
That's one thing about intellectuals:

376
00:21:12,316 --> 00:21:15,797  X1:151 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
They've proved you can be brilliant
and have no idea what's going on.

377
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:20,507  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
But, on the other hand,
the body doesn't lie as we now know.

378
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,285  X1:263 X2:459 Y1:374 Y2:410
Stop acting out.

379
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,360  X1:175 X2:547 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt'll be great, because all those
Ph.D.s are in there discussing...

380
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:30,142  X1:146 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
modes of alienation,
and we'll be in here quietly humping.

381
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:34,585  X1:224 X2:498 Y1:334 Y2:409
Don't. You're using sex
to express hostility.

382
00:21:34,658 --> 00:21:39,296  X1:126 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
"Why do you always reduce my animal
urges to psychoanalytic categories,"...

383
00:21:39,363 --> 00:21:42,266  X1:145 X2:576 Y1:374 Y2:410
he said as he removed her brassier.

384
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:48,097  X1:164 X2:557 Y1:334 Y2:409
There are people out there
from the New Yorker magazine!

385
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:51,068  X1:217 X2:504 Y1:334 Y2:409
My God!
What would they think?

386
00:21:57,576 --> 00:22:00,392  X1:255 X2:467 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Damn siren!
- Don't get upset.

387
00:22:00,457 --> 00:22:02,246  X1:222 X2:499 Y1:374 Y2:410
Damn it! l was so close!

388
00:22:02,313 --> 00:22:04,900  X1:223 X2:498 Y1:334 Y2:409
Last night it was a guy
honking his car horn.

389
00:22:04,971 --> 00:22:07,841  X1:205 X2:516 Y1:374 Y2:410
The city can't close down.

390
00:22:07,915 --> 00:22:11,298  X1:147 X2:574 Y1:334 Y2:409
You want them to close the airport
so we can have sex?

391
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:13,926  X1:267 X2:454 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm too tense.
l need a Valium.

392
00:22:13,997 --> 00:22:16,867  X1:151 X2:570 Y1:334 Y2:409
My analyst says l should live
in the country and not in New York.

393
00:22:16,942 --> 00:22:20,325  X1:112 X2:609 Y1:334 Y2:409
We can't have this discussion all
the time. The country makes me nervous.

394
00:22:20,398 --> 00:22:24,109  X1:133 X2:589 Y1:334 Y2:409
You've got crickets. lt's quiet.
There's no place to walk after dinner.

395
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,079  X1:157 X2:565 Y1:334 Y2:409
There's the screens
with the dead moths behind them.

396
00:22:27,153 --> 00:22:30,023  X1:140 X2:582 Y1:334 Y2:409
You got the Manson family, possibly.
You got Dick and Perry.

397
00:22:30,097 --> 00:22:34,887  X1:135 X2:587 Y1:334 Y2:409
Okay! My analyst just thinks l'm too
tense! Where's the goddamn Valium?

398
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:37,265  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
Okay, it's quiet now.
We can get started again.

399
00:22:37,331 --> 00:22:39,982  X1:191 X2:531 Y1:374 Y2:410
l can't! My head is throbbing.

400
00:22:40,051 --> 00:22:42,092  X1:223 X2:498 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You got a headache?
- l have a headache!

401
00:22:42,165 --> 00:22:44,915  X1:217 X2:505 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Bad?
- Like Oswald in Ghosts.

402
00:22:44,981 --> 00:22:47,283  X1:219 X2:502 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Jesus.
- Where are you going?

403
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,612  X1:145 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm going to take another in a series
of cold showers.

404
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,947  X1:153 X2:569 Y1:334 Y2:409
Max, my serve is going to send you
to the showers early.

405
00:22:53,015 --> 00:22:54,925  X1:200 X2:522 Y1:334 Y2:409
Right. To get back to what
we were discussing.

406
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,296  X1:121 X2:600 Y1:334 Y2:409
The failure of the country to get behind
New York City is anti-Semitism.

407
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,183  X1:196 X2:525 Y1:374 Y2:410
Max, the city is terribly run.

408
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:03,479  X1:179 X2:543 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm not discussing politics
or economics. This is foreskin.

409
00:23:03,547 --> 00:23:07,476  X1:104 X2:617 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's a convenient out. When some group
disagrees with you, it's anti-Semitism.

410
00:23:07,547 --> 00:23:09,969  X1:218 X2:503 Y1:334 Y2:409
The rest of the country
looks upon New York...

411
00:23:10,044 --> 00:23:13,787  X1:117 X2:605 Y1:334 Y2:409
like we're left-wing, communist, Jewish,
homosexual pornographers.

412
00:23:13,853 --> 00:23:16,342  X1:159 X2:562 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think of us that way sometimes,
and l live here.

413
00:23:16,414 --> 00:23:20,757  X1:131 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
Max, if we lived in California, we could
play outdoors every day in the sun.

414
00:23:20,831 --> 00:23:23,865  X1:157 X2:565 Y1:334 Y2:409
Sun is bad for you. Everything
our parents said was good is bad.

415
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,424  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:374 Y2:410
Sun, milk, red meat, college.

416
00:23:28,097 --> 00:23:29,985  X1:232 X2:489 Y1:374 Y2:410
Egad, here he comes.

417
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:35,775  X1:263 X2:459 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know Alvy?
This is Janet.

418
00:23:35,842 --> 00:23:39,291  X1:250 X2:472 Y1:334 Y2:409
- This is Annie Hall.
- This is Alvy.

419
00:23:39,364 --> 00:23:42,812  X1:172 X2:549 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Who's playing with who here?
- You and me against them?

420
00:23:42,885 --> 00:23:44,892  X1:227 X2:494 Y1:334 Y2:409
- That's not fair.
- l can't play too good.

421
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,373  X1:232 X2:489 Y1:374 Y2:410
l've had four lessons.

422
00:24:08,395 --> 00:24:10,338  X1:325 X2:396 Y1:374 Y2:410
Well...

423
00:24:10,412 --> 00:24:11,841  X1:335 X2:387 Y1:374 Y2:410
bye.

424
00:24:15,085 --> 00:24:18,348  X1:229 X2:493 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You play very well.
- Oh, yeah? So do you!

425
00:24:18,414 --> 00:24:21,349  X1:174 X2:547 Y1:374 Y2:410
God, what a dumb thing to say.

426
00:24:21,423 --> 00:24:26,094  X1:123 X2:599 Y1:334 Y2:409
You say "You play well," and right away
l have to say, "You play well."

427
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,234  X1:269 X2:452 Y1:374 Y2:410
Oh, God, Annie.

428
00:24:28,304 --> 00:24:31,305  X1:279 X2:443 Y1:374 Y2:410
Well. Oh, well!

429
00:24:31,378 --> 00:24:33,713  X1:293 X2:428 Y1:374 Y2:410
La-de-dah.

430
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:36,531  X1:261 X2:460 Y1:374 Y2:410
You want a lift?

431
00:24:36,595 --> 00:24:40,938  X1:270 X2:452 Y1:334 Y2:409
Oh, why?
You got a car?

432
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,697  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:374 Y2:410
No, l was going to take a cab.

433
00:24:43,766 --> 00:24:46,155  X1:245 X2:477 Y1:374 Y2:410
Oh, no. l have a car.

434
00:24:47,158 --> 00:24:49,013  X1:261 X2:460 Y1:374 Y2:410
You have a car?

435
00:24:50,935 --> 00:24:52,845  X1:250 X2:471 Y1:374 Y2:410
lf you have a car...

436
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:56,236  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:334 Y2:409
then why did you say, "Do you have
a car" like you wanted a lift?

437
00:24:58,617 --> 00:25:01,106  X1:247 X2:474 Y1:334 Y2:409
Geez, l don't know.
l wasn't--

438
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:06,010  X1:221 X2:501 Y1:374 Y2:410
l got this VW out there.

439
00:25:06,075 --> 00:25:07,567  X1:285 X2:436 Y1:374 Y2:410
What a jerk.

440
00:25:07,695 --> 00:25:10,413  X1:235 X2:486 Y1:374 Y2:410
Would you like a lift?

441
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,475  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Sure. Which way are you going?
- Me? Oh, downtown.

442
00:25:14,545 --> 00:25:16,433  X1:255 X2:467 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm going uptown.

443
00:25:16,498 --> 00:25:18,833  X1:205 X2:516 Y1:374 Y2:410
Oh, l'm going uptown, too.

444
00:25:18,898 --> 00:25:22,379  X1:136 X2:586 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You said you were going downtown.
- Yeah, well--

445
00:25:22,451 --> 00:25:24,786  X1:235 X2:486 Y1:334 Y2:409
l can go uptown, too.
l live uptown.

446
00:25:24,851 --> 00:25:28,595  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
What the hell? lt would be nice
having company. l hate driving alone.

447
00:25:29,589 --> 00:25:31,924  X1:178 X2:544 Y1:334 Y2:409
How long do you know Janet?
Where do you know her from?

448
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,511  X1:220 X2:501 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm in her acting class.
- You're an actress!

449
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,688  X1:175 X2:547 Y1:374 Y2:410
Well, l do commercials, sort of.

450
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:40,055  X1:156 X2:565 Y1:334 Y2:409
You want to watch the road?
You're not from New York, right?

451
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,990  X1:256 X2:465 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Chippewa Falls.
- Right.

452
00:25:43,065 --> 00:25:45,040  X1:288 X2:433 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Where?
- Wisconsin.

453
00:25:45,113 --> 00:25:48,692  X1:140 X2:581 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You're driving a tad rapidly.
- Don't worry. l'm a very good driver.

454
00:25:50,555 --> 00:25:52,857  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You want some gum?
- No, thanks.

455
00:25:52,923 --> 00:25:56,273  X1:128 X2:594 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Where is it?
- Don't do that. No, no, watch the road.

456
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:58,104  X1:229 X2:493 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'll get it.
Concentrate, will ya?

457
00:25:58,173 --> 00:26:00,857  X1:243 X2:479 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'll get you a piece.
- Listen. You drive?

458
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:03,894  X1:170 X2:552 Y1:334 Y2:409
Do l drive?
No, l got a problem with driving.

459
00:26:03,966 --> 00:26:05,941  X1:302 X2:419 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You do?
- Yeah.

460
00:26:06,015 --> 00:26:08,918  X1:188 X2:533 Y1:334 Y2:409
l got a license,
but l have too much hostility.

461
00:26:10,144 --> 00:26:12,381  X1:262 X2:459 Y1:334 Y2:409
Nice car.
You keep it nice.

462
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:15,930  X1:153 X2:569 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Can l ask you, is this a sandwich?
- Oh, yeah.

463
00:26:20,963 --> 00:26:24,608  X1:165 X2:557 Y1:334 Y2:409
l live over here. Oh, my God, look!
There's a parking space.

464
00:26:29,605 --> 00:26:32,453  X1:149 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's okay,
we can walk to the curb from here.

465
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:36,161  X1:187 X2:535 Y1:334 Y2:409
You want your tennis stuff?
You want your gear?

466
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:39,014  X1:198 X2:523 Y1:334 Y2:409
Yeah. That's good. Thanks.
Thanks a lot. Well.

467
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,455  X1:331 X2:390 Y1:374 Y2:410
Well.

468
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,168  X1:288 X2:434 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

469
00:26:44,234 --> 00:26:46,951  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:374 Y2:410
You're a wonderful tennis player...

470
00:26:47,018 --> 00:26:49,441  X1:194 X2:528 Y1:334 Y2:409
and you're the worst driver
l've ever seen in my life.

471
00:26:49,514 --> 00:26:53,127  X1:154 X2:568 Y1:374 Y2:410
Anyplace. Europe. Anyplace. Asia.

472
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,465  X1:190 X2:532 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l love what you're wearing.
- You do? Yeah.

473
00:26:55,532 --> 00:27:01,72  X1:125 X2:597 Y1:374 Y2:410
This tie is a present from Grammy Hall.

474
00:27:01,78 --> 00:27:02,179  X1:237 X2:485 Y1:374 Y2:410
Who? Grammy Hall?

475
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:03,880  X1:248 X2:474 Y1:374 Y2:410
Yeah, my grammy.

476
00:27:03,951 --> 00:27:06,985  X1:099 X2:622 Y1:334 Y2:409
What did you do, grow up in a
Norman Rockwell painting? Your grammy?

477
00:27:07,055 --> 00:27:11,180  X1:173 X2:548 Y1:334 Y2:409
- lt's pretty silly, isn't it?
- My grammy never gave gifts.

478
00:27:11,248 --> 00:27:14,064  X1:167 X2:555 Y1:334 Y2:409
She was too busy getting raped
by Cossacks.

479
00:27:14,129 --> 00:27:16,268  X1:230 X2:492 Y1:374 Y2:410
Well, thank you again.

480
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:17,832  X1:305 X2:417 Y1:374 Y2:410
Oh, yeah.

481
00:27:17,906 --> 00:27:21,616  X1:120 X2:602 Y1:334 Y2:409
Listen. You want to come upstairs
and have a glass of wine or something?

482
00:27:21,684 --> 00:27:25,001  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, l mean you don't have to.
You're probably late and everything.

483
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:27,314  X1:224 X2:497 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, that would be fine.
l wouldn't mind. Sure.

484
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:31,823  X1:180 X2:541 Y1:334 Y2:409
l got time. l got nothing
until my analyst appointment.

485
00:27:31,894 --> 00:27:33,870  X1:237 X2:484 Y1:374 Y2:410
You see an analyst?

486
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:37,522  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Just for 15 years.
- 15 years?

487
00:27:37,592 --> 00:27:40,014  X1:145 X2:576 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm going to give him one more year,
and then l'm going to Lourdes.

488
00:27:40,088 --> 00:27:42,958  X1:160 X2:561 Y1:374 Y2:410
15? Nah, come on! Yeah? Really?

489
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:46,359  X1:162 X2:559 Y1:334 Y2:409
Sylvia Plath. lnteresting poetess
whose tragic suicide...

490
00:27:46,426 --> 00:27:50,071  X1:163 X2:559 Y1:334 Y2:409
was misinterpreted as romantic
by the college-girl mentality.

491
00:27:51,067 --> 00:27:54,581  X1:129 X2:593 Y1:334 Y2:409
Right. l don't know.
l mean, some of her poems seem neat.

492
00:27:54,652 --> 00:27:57,849  X1:147 X2:575 Y1:374 Y2:410
Neat? l hate to tell you this is 1975.

493
00:27:57,917 --> 00:28:00,220  X1:201 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
"Neat" went out
at the turn of the century.

494
00:28:00,286 --> 00:28:02,490  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:374 Y2:410
Who are those photos on the wall?

495
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:05,145  X1:282 X2:439 Y1:374 Y2:410
Oh, you see...

496
00:28:05,215 --> 00:28:09,144  X1:180 X2:541 Y1:334 Y2:409
that's my dad, that's Father,
and that's my brother, Duane.

497
00:28:09,216 --> 00:28:11,999  X1:175 X2:546 Y1:334 Y2:409
Yeah, right.
And over there's Grammy Hall.

498
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,881  X1:248 X2:473 Y1:334 Y2:409
- And that's Sadie.
- Who's Sadie?

499
00:28:14,946 --> 00:28:20,414  X1:141 X2:580 Y1:334 Y2:409
Well, Sadie met Grammy
through Grammy's brother, George.

500
00:28:20,483 --> 00:28:22,720  X1:214 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
George was real sweet.
He had that thing.

501
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:28,005  X1:119 X2:603 Y1:334 Y2:409
What is that thing where you fall asleep
in the middle of a sentence?

502
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:29,924  X1:279 X2:443 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Narcolepsy.
- Right.

503
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:34,595  X1:135 X2:587 Y1:334 Y2:409
So anyway, George went to the union
to get his free turkey...

504
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:38,177  X1:123 X2:599 Y1:334 Y2:409
because the union always gave George
this free turkey at Christmastime...

505
00:28:38,248 --> 00:28:41,632  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:334 Y2:409
because he was shell-shocked
in the first World War.

506
00:28:41,704 --> 00:28:45,535  X1:128 X2:594 Y1:374 Y2:410
Anyway, so George is standing in line...

507
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,912  X1:212 X2:509 Y1:374 Y2:410
getting his free turkey...

508
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:52,835  X1:176 X2:546 Y1:334 Y2:409
but the thing is he falls asleep,
and he never wakes up.

509
00:28:52,908 --> 00:28:55,495  X1:281 X2:440 Y1:374 Y2:410
So he's dead.

510
00:28:55,564 --> 00:28:57,769  X1:261 X2:460 Y1:374 Y2:410
He's dead. Yeah.

511
00:28:57,837 --> 00:28:59,299  X1:305 X2:416 Y1:374 Y2:410
Oh, dear.

512
00:28:59,374 --> 00:29:02,025  X1:246 X2:475 Y1:334 Y2:409
Well, terrible, huh?
Wouldn't you say?

513
00:29:02,094 --> 00:29:03,753  X1:278 X2:444 Y1:374 Y2:410
Pretty awful.

514
00:29:03,823 --> 00:29:07,021  X1:205 X2:517 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's a great story, though.
lt really made my day.

515
00:29:07,088 --> 00:29:10,056  X1:179 X2:542 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think l should get out of here,
'cause l think l'm imposing.

516
00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:13,129  X1:261 X2:461 Y1:374 Y2:410
Really? Maybe--

517
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:17,326  X1:135 X2:587 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You don't have to.
- But l'm all perspired and everything.

518
00:29:17,394 --> 00:29:19,883  X1:136 X2:586 Y1:374 Y2:410
Didn't you take a shower at the club?

519
00:29:19,955 --> 00:29:22,411  X1:228 X2:494 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, no. l never shower
in a public place.

520
00:29:22,483 --> 00:29:23,858  X1:302 X2:419 Y1:374 Y2:410
Why not?

521
00:29:23,924 --> 00:29:27,886  X1:172 X2:549 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't like to get naked in front
of another man.

522
00:29:27,957 --> 00:29:29,332  X1:329 X2:392 Y1:374 Y2:410
l see.

523
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:32,715  X1:197 X2:525 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't like to show my body
to a man of my gender.

524
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:35,312  X1:108 X2:614 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l see, l guess.
- You never know what's going to happen.

525
00:29:35,383 --> 00:29:38,581  X1:260 X2:461 Y1:334 Y2:409
- 15 years, huh?
- 15 years, yeah.

526
00:29:39,257 --> 00:29:40,631  X1:298 X2:424 Y1:374 Y2:410
God bless.

527
00:29:44,762 --> 00:29:47,065  X1:292 X2:429 Y1:374 Y2:410
Well! Well--

528
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:51,094  X1:206 X2:516 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're what Grammy Hall
would call "a real Jew."

529
00:29:53,628 --> 00:29:55,003  X1:296 X2:426 Y1:374 Y2:410
Thank you.

530
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:59,257  X1:159 X2:563 Y1:334 Y2:409
She hates Jews.
She thinks they just make money.

531
00:29:59,325 --> 00:30:02,293  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:334 Y2:409
But she's the one, is she ever.
l'm telling you.

532
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,528  X1:185 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
So, did you do
those photographs in there?

533
00:30:10,689 --> 00:30:14,520  X1:148 X2:574 Y1:070 Y2:457
l dabble? Listen to me. What a jerk.
Yeah, l sort of dabble around,
you know.

534
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:18,652  X1:190 X2:532 Y1:070 Y2:457
You are a great-looking girl.
They're wonderful.
They have a quality.

535
00:30:18,723 --> 00:30:22,750  X1:174 X2:547 Y1:070 Y2:457
He probably thinks l'm a yo-yo.
Well, l would like to take
a serious photography course.

536
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,708  X1:136 X2:585 Y1:374 Y2:410
Photography's interesting because...

537
00:30:24,773 --> 00:30:28,930  X1:129 X2:593 Y1:070 Y2:457
l wonder what she looks like naked.
it's a new art form. A set of aesthetic
criteria have not emerged yet.

538
00:30:28,997 --> 00:30:32,643  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:070 Y2:457
l'm not smart enough for him.
Hang in there.
You mean whether
it's a good photo or not?

539
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:37,469  X1:146 X2:576 Y1:070 Y2:457
l don't know what l'm saying.
She senses l'm shallow.
The medium enters in as a condition
of the art form itself.

540
00:30:37,577 --> 00:30:42,312  X1:170 X2:551 Y1:070 Y2:457
God, l hope he doesn't turn out
to be a schmuck like the others.
Well, to me-- l mean--
lt's all instinctive.

541
00:30:42,378 --> 00:30:47,114  X1:149 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
l just try to feel it, to get a sense
of it and not think about it so much.

542
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:52,483  X1:153 X2:569 Y1:070 Y2:457
Christ, l sound like FM radio. Relax.
Still, you need aesthetic guidelines
to put it in social perspective.

543
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,123  X1:167 X2:555 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know. l mean,
l guess you must be sort of late.

544
00:30:57,197 --> 00:31:01,705  X1:174 X2:548 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know, l've got to get there
and begin whining soon.

545
00:31:01,775 --> 00:31:03,685  X1:198 X2:523 Y1:374 Y2:410
Are you busy Friday night?

546
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,827  X1:291 X2:430 Y1:374 Y2:410
Me? Oh, no.

547
00:31:06,896 --> 00:31:09,996  X1:173 X2:548 Y1:334 Y2:409
Oh, l'm sorry, l have something.
What about Saturday night?

548
00:31:12,082 --> 00:31:13,937  X1:267 X2:455 Y1:374 Y2:410
Nothing. No, no.

549
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:17,102  X1:178 X2:543 Y1:374 Y2:410
You're very popular, l can see.

550
00:31:17,171 --> 00:31:19,026  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l know.
- You have plague?

551
00:31:19,091 --> 00:31:21,513  X1:238 X2:484 Y1:374 Y2:410
l meet a lot of jerks.

552
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,498  X1:211 X2:511 Y1:374 Y2:410
l meet a lot of jerks, too.

553
00:31:23,573 --> 00:31:26,574  X1:245 X2:476 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm thinking about
getting some cats.

554
00:31:26,646 --> 00:31:30,225  X1:229 X2:493 Y1:334 Y2:409
Wait a second! No, no!
Oh, shoot!

555
00:31:30,295 --> 00:31:34,573  X1:163 X2:558 Y1:374 Y2:410
Saturday night, l'm going to sing.

556
00:31:34,647 --> 00:31:37,037  X1:170 X2:552 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're going to sing? You sing?
No kidding!

557
00:31:37,113 --> 00:31:39,983  X1:229 X2:492 Y1:334 Y2:409
- This is my first time.
- Really? Where?

558
00:31:40,057 --> 00:31:42,229  X1:269 X2:453 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'd like to come.

559
00:31:42,297 --> 00:31:44,916  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm interested.
- No, no. l'm just a--

560
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:48,850  X1:201 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm auditioning at this club.
lt's my first time.

561
00:31:48,923 --> 00:31:51,291  X1:155 X2:567 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's okay, 'cause l know exactly
what that's like.

562
00:31:51,356 --> 00:31:54,074  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're going to like nightclubs.
They're really a lot of fun.

563
00:31:59,262 --> 00:32:01,718  X1:268 X2:453 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt had to be you

564
00:32:04,671 --> 00:32:11,100  X1:268 X2:453 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt had to be you

565
00:32:12,578 --> 00:32:17,281  X1:247 X2:475 Y1:334 Y2:409
l wandered around
And finally found

566
00:32:17,348 --> 00:32:23,579  X1:242 X2:480 Y1:374 Y2:410
This somebody who

567
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:29,949  X1:222 X2:500 Y1:374 Y2:410
Could make me be true

568
00:32:30,023 --> 00:32:34,978  X1:223 X2:498 Y1:374 Y2:410
Could make me be blue

569
00:32:36,905 --> 00:32:39,840  X1:257 X2:465 Y1:374 Y2:410
And even be glad

570
00:32:39,913 --> 00:32:42,369  X1:274 X2:447 Y1:374 Y2:410
Just to be sad

571
00:32:43,658 --> 00:32:49,257  X1:269 X2:453 Y1:374 Y2:410
Thinking of you

572
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:52,518  X1:189 X2:533 Y1:334 Y2:409
l was awful! l'm so ashamed!
l can't sing.

573
00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:54,596  X1:145 X2:577 Y1:374 Y2:410
So the audience was a tad restless.

574
00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:57,834  X1:139 X2:582 Y1:334 Y2:409
What do you mean, "a tad restless"?
My God, they hated me!

575
00:32:57,902 --> 00:33:00,204  X1:189 X2:532 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, they didn't.
You have a wonderful voice.

576
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:02,180  X1:214 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm going to quit.
- l'm not going to let you.

577
00:33:02,255 --> 00:33:04,645  X1:209 X2:512 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You have a great voice.
- Do you think so, really?

578
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,812  X1:154 X2:568 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Yeah! lt's terrific.
- l never even took a lesson either.

579
00:33:08,881 --> 00:33:12,198  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Listen, give me a kiss.
- Really?

580
00:33:12,274 --> 00:33:14,828  X1:147 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
Why not? Because we're just going
to go home later.

581
00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:17,288  X1:148 X2:574 Y1:334 Y2:409
There's going to be all that tension.
We've never kissed before.

582
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:19,371  X1:216 X2:506 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'll never know when
to make the right move.

583
00:33:19,444 --> 00:33:22,096  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:334 Y2:409
We'll kiss now and get it over with,
and then we'll go eat. Okay?

584
00:33:22,165 --> 00:33:24,434  X1:189 X2:533 Y1:374 Y2:410
We'll digest our food better.

585
00:33:26,197 --> 00:33:29,178  X1:145 X2:577 Y1:374 Y2:410
Okay? Now we can digest our food.

586
00:33:29,306 --> 00:33:31,380  X1:233 X2:489 Y1:374 Y2:410
Corned beef, please.

587
00:33:31,451 --> 00:33:34,451  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm having pastrami on white bread...

588
00:33:34,524 --> 00:33:37,372  X1:116 X2:605 Y1:374 Y2:410
with mayonnaise, tomatoes and lettuce.

589
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:42,997  X1:181 X2:541 Y1:374 Y2:410
So, your second wife left you.

590
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,623  X1:158 X2:563 Y1:374 Y2:410
Were you depressed about that?

591
00:33:45,695 --> 00:33:49,177  X1:149 X2:572 Y1:334 Y2:409
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins
couldn't cure.

592
00:33:49,248 --> 00:33:52,958  X1:210 X2:511 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Your first wife, Allison.
- She was nice.

593
00:33:53,024 --> 00:33:55,414  X1:245 X2:476 Y1:334 Y2:409
That was my fault.
l was too crazy.

594
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:02,685  X1:255 X2:466 Y1:334 Y2:409
That was so nice!
That was nice.

595
00:34:02,755 --> 00:34:06,466  X1:192 X2:530 Y1:334 Y2:409
As Balzac said,
"There goes another novel."

596
00:34:07,525 --> 00:34:09,184  X1:261 X2:461 Y1:374 Y2:410
You were great.

597
00:34:09,253 --> 00:34:11,709  X1:257 X2:465 Y1:374 Y2:410
Oh, yeah? Yeah?

598
00:34:11,781 --> 00:34:15,776  X1:238 X2:483 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Yeah, l'm wrecked.
- You're wrecked.

599
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:20,191  X1:183 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
l mean it.
l'll never play the piano again.

600
00:34:20,265 --> 00:34:23,265  X1:167 X2:555 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt was, l don't know.
You really thought it was good?

601
00:34:23,337 --> 00:34:28,576  X1:129 X2:592 Y1:334 Y2:409
Good? Yes. No, that was the most fun
l've had without laughing.

602
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:30,440  X1:225 X2:497 Y1:374 Y2:410
Here, you want some?

603
00:34:30,507 --> 00:34:35,778  X1:200 X2:521 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, l don't use
any major hallucinogenics.

604
00:34:35,852 --> 00:34:40,131  X1:154 X2:567 Y1:334 Y2:409
l took a puff about five years ago
at a party...

605
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:42,989  X1:175 X2:547 Y1:334 Y2:409
and tried to take my pants off
over my head.

606
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:50,538  X1:205 X2:517 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't do it very often.
lt just sort of relaxes me.

607
00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:55,719  X1:182 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You won't believe this, but--
- What?

608
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,778  X1:157 X2:564 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm going to buy you these books...

609
00:35:01,844 --> 00:35:05,008  X1:139 X2:582 Y1:334 Y2:409
because l think you should read them
instead of that cat book.

610
00:35:05,076 --> 00:35:07,728  X1:191 X2:531 Y1:374 Y2:410
That's pretty serious stuff.

611
00:35:07,797 --> 00:35:10,132  X1:169 X2:552 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm obsessed with death, l think.

612
00:35:10,198 --> 00:35:13,101  X1:167 X2:554 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's a big subject with me.
l have a pessimistic view of life.

613
00:35:13,175 --> 00:35:15,445  X1:175 X2:547 Y1:334 Y2:409
You should know this about me
if we're going to go out.

614
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:18,577  X1:149 X2:572 Y1:334 Y2:409
l feel that life is divided up
into the horrible and the miserable.

615
00:35:18,647 --> 00:35:20,558  X1:176 X2:546 Y1:374 Y2:410
Those are the two categories.

616
00:35:20,632 --> 00:35:25,205  X1:154 X2:567 Y1:334 Y2:409
The horrible would be like terminal
cases and blind people, cripples.

617
00:35:25,273 --> 00:35:27,641  X1:129 X2:592 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know how they get through life.
lt's amazing to me.

618
00:35:27,706 --> 00:35:30,390  X1:146 X2:575 Y1:374 Y2:410
And the miserable is everyone else.

619
00:35:30,459 --> 00:35:32,794  X1:154 X2:567 Y1:334 Y2:409
So when you go through life,
be thankful that you're miserable.

620
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,446  X1:156 X2:565 Y1:374 Y2:410
You're very lucky to be miserable.

621
00:35:36,957 --> 00:35:41,595  X1:149 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
Look at that guy.
There's Mr. Miami Beach in the pink.

622
00:35:41,662 --> 00:35:44,314  X1:200 X2:522 Y1:334 Y2:409
He's just come back
from the gin rummy finals.

623
00:35:44,383 --> 00:35:46,139  X1:266 X2:456 Y1:374 Y2:410
He placed third.

624
00:35:46,207 --> 00:35:49,110  X1:144 X2:578 Y1:334 Y2:409
Look at these guys. That's hilarious.
They're back from Fire lsland.

625
00:35:49,184 --> 00:35:51,934  X1:217 X2:504 Y1:334 Y2:409
They're sort of giving it
a chance romantically.

626
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,783  X1:229 X2:493 Y1:334 Y2:409
- ltalian, right?
- Him? He's the Mafia.

627
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:58,047  X1:195 X2:527 Y1:334 Y2:409
Linen supply business
or cement and contracting.

628
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,563  X1:187 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
Oh, gee,
mess up my moustache wax.

629
00:36:01,635 --> 00:36:04,320  X1:108 X2:613 Y1:334 Y2:409
There's the winner of the Truman Capote
look-alike contest.

630
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:08,994  X1:200 X2:521 Y1:334 Y2:409
You are unbelievably sexy.
Yes, you are.

631
00:36:09,062 --> 00:36:12,772  X1:158 X2:563 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know what you are?
You're polymorphously perverse.

632
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,261  X1:209 X2:513 Y1:334 Y2:409
What does that mean?
l don't know what that is.

633
00:36:15,335 --> 00:36:18,151  X1:199 X2:522 Y1:374 Y2:410
You're exceptional in bed...

634
00:36:18,216 --> 00:36:21,086  X1:123 X2:599 Y1:334 Y2:409
because you get pleasure in every part
of your body when l touch it.

635
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,838  X1:128 X2:594 Y1:334 Y2:409
Like the tip of your nose, and if
l stroke your teeth or your knee caps...

636
00:36:24,906 --> 00:36:26,978  X1:206 X2:515 Y1:374 Y2:410
you certainly get excited.

637
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:31,208  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know what?
l like you, l really do.

638
00:36:31,275 --> 00:36:34,091  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:334 Y2:409
But do you love me?
That's the key question.

639
00:36:34,156 --> 00:36:36,393  X1:190 X2:532 Y1:334 Y2:409
l know you've only known me
a short while.

640
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:40,259  X1:228 X2:494 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think that's sort of--
Yeah, yeah.

641
00:36:40,334 --> 00:36:42,189  X1:262 X2:459 Y1:374 Y2:410
Do you love me?

642
00:36:42,254 --> 00:36:47,493  X1:145 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
Love is too weak a word for what--
l "lurve" you.

643
00:36:47,568 --> 00:36:51,693  X1:207 X2:515 Y1:334 Y2:409
l "loave" you.
l "luff" you, with two "f"s.

644
00:36:51,761 --> 00:36:53,834  X1:240 X2:482 Y1:334 Y2:409
Of course l do.
Don't you think l do?

645
00:36:53,906 --> 00:36:55,914  X1:285 X2:436 Y1:374 Y2:410
l don't know.

646
00:36:57,714 --> 00:37:00,465  X1:112 X2:609 Y1:334 Y2:409
What do you mean? You're not going
to give up your own apartment, are you?

647
00:37:00,531 --> 00:37:02,386  X1:288 X2:434 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Of course.
- But why?

648
00:37:02,451 --> 00:37:04,623  X1:157 X2:565 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm moving in with you, that's why.

649
00:37:04,692 --> 00:37:07,628  X1:164 X2:558 Y1:334 Y2:409
- But you have a nice apartment.
- l have a tiny apartment.

650
00:37:07,702 --> 00:37:10,604  X1:139 X2:582 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l know it's small.
- And it's got bad plumbing and bugs.

651
00:37:10,678 --> 00:37:15,382  X1:126 X2:595 Y1:334 Y2:409
Granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs.
You say that like it's a negative.

652
00:37:15,447 --> 00:37:17,553  X1:295 X2:427 Y1:374 Y2:410
Bugs are--

653
00:37:17,624 --> 00:37:21,334  X1:125 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Entomology is a rapidly growing field.
- You don't want me to live with you.

654
00:37:21,401 --> 00:37:25,198  X1:186 X2:535 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l don't? Whose idea was it?
- Mine.

655
00:37:25,274 --> 00:37:27,511  X1:227 X2:494 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt was yours, actually.

656
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,816  X1:179 X2:542 Y1:374 Y2:410
But l approved it immediately.

657
00:37:29,884 --> 00:37:31,739  X1:233 X2:489 Y1:334 Y2:409
You think l talked you
into something.

658
00:37:31,804 --> 00:37:36,180  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
No. We live together,
we sleep together, we eat together.

659
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:38,458  X1:184 X2:538 Y1:334 Y2:409
Jesus, you don't want it to be
like we're married, do you?

660
00:37:38,526 --> 00:37:42,324  X1:112 X2:609 Y1:334 Y2:409
- How is it any different?
- Because you keep your own apartment.

661
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:44,821  X1:148 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's there. We don't have to go to it,
deal with it...

662
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:49,785  X1:132 X2:589 Y1:334 Y2:409
but it's like a free-floating life raft
that we know that we're not married.

663
00:37:49,856 --> 00:37:52,246  X1:224 X2:498 Y1:334 Y2:409
That little apartment
is $400 a month, Alvy.

664
00:37:52,322 --> 00:37:55,322  X1:176 X2:545 Y1:334 Y2:409
- That place is $400 a month?
- Yes, it is.

665
00:37:55,394 --> 00:37:58,363  X1:174 X2:547 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's got bad plumbing and bugs.
Jesus.

666
00:37:58,435 --> 00:38:02,266  X1:168 X2:554 Y1:334 Y2:409
My accountant will write it off
as a tax deduction. l'll pay for it.

667
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,861  X1:164 X2:558 Y1:334 Y2:409
You don't think l'm smart enough
to be serious about.

668
00:38:04,933 --> 00:38:06,526  X1:247 X2:475 Y1:374 Y2:410
Don't be ridiculous.

669
00:38:06,597 --> 00:38:10,689  X1:117 X2:605 Y1:334 Y2:409
Then why are you always pushing me
to take college courses like l was dumb?

670
00:38:10,758 --> 00:38:12,831  X1:138 X2:584 Y1:374 Y2:410
Adult education is a wonderful thing!

671
00:38:12,903 --> 00:38:16,035  X1:185 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
You meet a lot of interesting
professors. lt's stimulating.

672
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:32,264  X1:151 X2:570 Y1:334 Y2:409
Does this sound like a good course:
"Modern American Poetry"?

673
00:38:33,292 --> 00:38:35,180  X1:278 X2:443 Y1:374 Y2:410
Or, let's see...

674
00:38:35,244 --> 00:38:39,174  X1:196 X2:525 Y1:334 Y2:409
maybe l should take
"lntroduction to the Novel."

675
00:38:39,246 --> 00:38:41,767  X1:143 X2:579 Y1:334 Y2:409
Just don't take any course
where they make you read Beowulf.

676
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,814  X1:318 X2:403 Y1:374 Y2:410
What?

677
00:38:43,887 --> 00:38:48,111  X1:162 X2:559 Y1:334 Y2:409
What do you think? Should we go
to that party in South Hampton?

678
00:38:48,177 --> 00:38:51,494  X1:144 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, don't be silly.
What do we need other people for?

679
00:38:51,569 --> 00:38:56,240  X1:123 X2:598 Y1:334 Y2:409
We should just turn out the lights
and play hide the "salam" or something.

680
00:38:56,307 --> 00:38:59,155  X1:160 X2:562 Y1:334 Y2:409
Well, l'm going to get a cigarette,
okay?

681
00:38:59,219 --> 00:39:04,240  X1:126 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
Grass, right? The illusion that it makes
a white woman more like Billie Holiday.

682
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:07,343  X1:165 X2:556 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Have you ever made love high?
- Me? No.

683
00:39:07,414 --> 00:39:10,927  X1:193 X2:529 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf l have grass or alcohol,
l get unbearably wonderful.

684
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:13,869  X1:176 X2:546 Y1:374 Y2:410
l get too wonderful for words.

685
00:39:13,944 --> 00:39:17,719  X1:137 X2:585 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know why you have to get high
every time we make love.

686
00:39:17,785 --> 00:39:19,574  X1:278 X2:443 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt relaxes me.

687
00:39:19,641 --> 00:39:22,097  X1:155 X2:567 Y1:334 Y2:409
You have to be artificially relaxed
before we can go to bed?

688
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:24,243  X1:162 X2:560 Y1:374 Y2:410
What's the difference, anyway?

689
00:39:24,314 --> 00:39:26,835  X1:145 X2:576 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'll give you a shot of Sodium
Pentothal. You can sleep through it.

690
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:30,137  X1:127 X2:595 Y1:334 Y2:409
Look who's talking! You've been seeing
a psychiatrist for 15 years.

691
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:33,620  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
You should smoke some of this.
You'd be off the couch in no time.

692
00:39:33,693 --> 00:39:35,832  X1:174 X2:548 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Come on, you don't need that.
- What are you doing?

693
00:39:35,901 --> 00:39:39,448  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
- No, Alvy, please?
- You can live without it once.

694
00:39:41,343 --> 00:39:43,351  X1:218 X2:504 Y1:374 Y2:410
Wait, l got a great idea.

695
00:39:44,576 --> 00:39:49,050  X1:189 X2:532 Y1:334 Y2:409
Hang in there for a second.
l got a little erotic artifact...

696
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:53,051  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
that l brought up from the city,
which l think is going to be perfect.

697
00:39:53,122 --> 00:39:56,800  X1:205 X2:516 Y1:334 Y2:409
There. Create a little
old New Orleans essence.

698
00:39:56,867 --> 00:40:01,93  X1:143 X2:579 Y1:374 Y2:410
Now we can go about our business...

699
00:40:00,004 --> 00:40:02,786  X1:172 X2:550 Y1:334 Y2:409
and even develop photographs
if we want to.

700
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:12,322  X1:225 X2:497 Y1:334 Y2:409
- ls something wrong?
- No, why?

701
00:40:12,391 --> 00:40:15,207  X1:217 X2:504 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know.
lt's like you're removed.

702
00:40:15,272 --> 00:40:17,159  X1:290 X2:431 Y1:374 Y2:410
No, l'm fine.

703
00:40:17,225 --> 00:40:19,135  X1:314 X2:407 Y1:374 Y2:410
Really?

704
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,730  X1:205 X2:517 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know.
You seem sort of distant.

705
00:40:21,802 --> 00:40:23,777  X1:212 X2:510 Y1:374 Y2:410
Let's just do it, all right?

706
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:27,167  X1:163 X2:559 Y1:334 Y2:409
Was it my imagination or are you
just going through the motions?

707
00:40:27,276 --> 00:40:29,447  X1:184 X2:538 Y1:334 Y2:409
Alvy, do you remember
where l put my drawing pad?

708
00:40:29,548 --> 00:40:32,364  X1:130 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
Because while you two are doing that,
l'm going to do some drawing.

709
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:34,601  X1:197 X2:524 Y1:374 Y2:410
That's what l call removed!

710
00:40:34,669 --> 00:40:37,539  X1:248 X2:473 Y1:374 Y2:410
You have my body.

711
00:40:37,614 --> 00:40:39,818  X1:201 X2:521 Y1:374 Y2:410
But l want the whole thing!

712
00:40:39,886 --> 00:40:41,742  X1:283 X2:438 Y1:374 Y2:410
l need grass.

713
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:44,623  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt ruins it for me if you have grass.

714
00:40:44,688 --> 00:40:47,885  X1:140 X2:582 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm like a comedian, so if l get a laugh
from a person who's high...

715
00:40:47,953 --> 00:40:50,671  X1:171 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
it doesn't count,
'cause they're always laughing.

716
00:40:50,737 --> 00:40:52,592  X1:210 X2:511 Y1:374 Y2:410
Were you always funny?

717
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:55,211  X1:151 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
ls this an interview?
We're supposed to be making love.

718
00:40:55,379 --> 00:40:58,511  X1:197 X2:525 Y1:334 Y2:409
This guy is naturally funny.
l think he can write for you.

719
00:40:58,579 --> 00:41:01,330  X1:182 X2:540 Y1:334 Y2:409
Yeah, yeah. Hey, kid,
he tells me you're really good.

720
00:41:01,397 --> 00:41:03,699  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
Let me explain how l work.
You can tell off the bat...

721
00:41:03,765 --> 00:41:06,548  X1:171 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
that l don't look like a funny guy
like some of the guys.

722
00:41:06,613 --> 00:41:08,883  X1:125 X2:597 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know they're going to tell you their
stories, you're going to fall down.

723
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:11,602  X1:120 X2:601 Y1:334 Y2:409
But l gotta be really talented.
Material's got to be sensational for me.

724
00:41:11,671 --> 00:41:15,447  X1:204 X2:518 Y1:334 Y2:409
l work-- l'm kind of classy.
Know what l mean?

725
00:41:15,512 --> 00:41:17,749  X1:183 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
Let me explain.
l'll open with an opening song.

726
00:41:17,817 --> 00:41:19,727  X1:239 X2:483 Y1:374 Y2:410
The music will start.

727
00:41:19,801 --> 00:41:22,485  X1:159 X2:563 Y1:334 Y2:409
l walk out.
Place looks wonderful from here

728
00:41:22,554 --> 00:41:25,173  X1:142 X2:580 Y1:374 Y2:410
You folks look wonderful from here

729
00:41:25,243 --> 00:41:27,731  X1:206 X2:516 Y1:334 Y2:409
And seeing you there
With a smile on your face

730
00:41:27,803 --> 00:41:30,073  X1:222 X2:499 Y1:334 Y2:409
Makes me shout
This must be the place

731
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,108  X1:125 X2:597 Y1:334 Y2:409
l stop, and then l open with some jokes.
That's where l need you.

732
00:41:33,181 --> 00:41:36,760  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'll say, "l just got back from Canada.
They speak a lot of French.

733
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:40,660  X1:129 X2:593 Y1:334 Y2:409
The only word to know is 'John Dark.' lt
means the light's out in the bathroom.

734
00:41:40,735 --> 00:41:44,926  X1:195 X2:527 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l met a big lumberjack."
- Jesus, this guy's pathetic.

735
00:41:44,992 --> 00:41:48,506  X1:191 X2:530 Y1:334 Y2:409
Look at him mincing around.
Boy, thinks he's real cute.

736
00:41:48,577 --> 00:41:50,781  X1:223 X2:499 Y1:374 Y2:410
You want to throw up.

737
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:53,720  X1:229 X2:493 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf only l had the nerve
to do my own jokes.

738
00:41:55,395 --> 00:41:58,527  X1:119 X2:602 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know how much longer l can keep
this smile frozen on my face.

739
00:41:58,596 --> 00:42:00,484  X1:204 X2:517 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm in the wrong business.
l know it.

740
00:42:00,548 --> 00:42:04,291  X1:281 X2:441 Y1:374 Y2:410
"But, cherie...

741
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:06,911  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:374 Y2:410
what will l do with this, eh?"

742
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:10,813  X1:164 X2:557 Y1:334 Y2:409
He says, "Oh, Marie,
sometime you make me so mad!"

743
00:42:10,887 --> 00:42:12,830  X1:127 X2:595 Y1:334 Y2:409
They scream at that.
Write me something like that, will you?

744
00:42:12,904 --> 00:42:15,487  X1:210 X2:512 Y1:334 Y2:409
Kind of a French number.
Can you do it?

745
00:42:21,473 --> 00:42:23,481  X1:207 X2:514 Y1:334 Y2:409
Where am l?
l have to reorient myself.

746
00:42:23,554 --> 00:42:25,464  X1:235 X2:487 Y1:334 Y2:409
This is the University
of Wisconsin, right?

747
00:42:25,538 --> 00:42:30,012  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
Because l'm always tense
when l'm playing a college.

748
00:42:30,084 --> 00:42:32,386  X1:157 X2:565 Y1:334 Y2:409
l have a bad history with colleges.
l went to New York University.

749
00:42:32,484 --> 00:42:36,282  X1:186 X2:536 Y1:334 Y2:409
And l was thrown out of NYU
my freshman year...

750
00:42:36,357 --> 00:42:39,522  X1:131 X2:590 Y1:374 Y2:410
for cheating on my metaphysics final.

751
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:43,747  X1:185 X2:536 Y1:334 Y2:409
l looked within the soul
of the boy sitting next to me.

752
00:42:43,816 --> 00:42:47,843  X1:115 X2:607 Y1:334 Y2:409
My mother, an emotionally high-strung
woman, locked herself in the bathroom...

753
00:42:47,913 --> 00:42:50,881  X1:229 X2:493 Y1:334 Y2:409
and took an overdose
of mah-jongg tiles.

754
00:42:53,962 --> 00:42:57,672  X1:181 X2:540 Y1:334 Y2:409
l was depressed at that time.
l was in analysis.

755
00:42:57,739 --> 00:43:01,384  X1:151 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
l was suicidal, as a matter of fact,
and would have killed myself...

756
00:43:01,452 --> 00:43:04,006  X1:226 X2:495 Y1:334 Y2:409
but l was in analysis
with a strict Freudian.

757
00:43:04,077 --> 00:43:07,591  X1:132 X2:589 Y1:334 Y2:409
And if you kill yourself, they make you
pay for the sessions you miss.

758
00:43:11,278 --> 00:43:15,208  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
Alvy, you were just great.
l'm not kidding.

759
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,964  X1:157 X2:565 Y1:374 Y2:410
College audiences are wonderful.

760
00:43:18,033 --> 00:43:21,033  X1:145 X2:576 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know what? l think l'm starting
to get more of the references, too.

761
00:43:21,105 --> 00:43:25,067  X1:131 X2:590 Y1:334 Y2:409
Are you? The 12:00 show
is completely different than the 9:00.

762
00:43:25,138 --> 00:43:29,230  X1:127 X2:595 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm looking forward to tomorrow. lt'll
be nice. You'll meet Mother and Father.

763
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,340  X1:189 X2:532 Y1:374 Y2:410
They'll hate me immediately.

764
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:35,700  X1:186 X2:536 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, l don't think they're going
to hate you at all. Contrary.

765
00:43:35,765 --> 00:43:40,044  X1:156 X2:565 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's Easter. We'll sit down and eat.
l think they'll really like you.

766
00:43:48,857 --> 00:43:50,516  X1:181 X2:541 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's a nice ham this year, Mom.

767
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:55,537  X1:129 X2:592 Y1:374 Y2:410
Grammy always does such a good job.

768
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:57,334  X1:281 X2:441 Y1:374 Y2:410
Great sauce.

769
00:43:57,403 --> 00:44:01,77  X1:250 X2:472 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt is.
lt's dynamite ham.

770
00:44:05,117 --> 00:44:07,900  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:374 Y2:410
We went to the swap meet.

771
00:44:07,966 --> 00:44:10,934  X1:175 X2:546 Y1:334 Y2:409
Annie, Gram and l.
Got some nice picture frames.

772
00:44:11,007 --> 00:44:14,357  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:374 Y2:410
We really had a good time.

773
00:44:14,432 --> 00:44:18,623  X1:174 X2:548 Y1:334 Y2:409
Ann tells us you've been seeing
a psychiatrist for 15 years.

774
00:44:19,746 --> 00:44:21,656  X1:147 X2:575 Y1:374 Y2:410
Yes. l'm making excellent progress.

775
00:44:21,729 --> 00:44:24,894  X1:143 X2:579 Y1:334 Y2:409
Soon, when l lie down on his couch,
l won't have to wear the lobster bib.

776
00:44:27,075 --> 00:44:30,589  X1:141 X2:581 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Duane and l went to the boat basin.
- We caulked hulls all day.

777
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,531  X1:125 X2:596 Y1:374 Y2:410
And Randolph Hunt was drunk as usual.

778
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:37,948  X1:155 X2:566 Y1:334 Y2:409
That Randolph Hunt!
You remember Randy Hunt, Annie.

779
00:44:38,022 --> 00:44:40,674  X1:183 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
- He was in the choir with you.
- Oh, yes.

780
00:44:40,743 --> 00:44:43,165  X1:207 X2:514 Y1:374 Y2:410
l can't believe this family.

781
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,990  X1:157 X2:565 Y1:374 Y2:410
Annie's mother is really beautiful.

782
00:44:46,056 --> 00:44:49,603  X1:166 X2:555 Y1:334 Y2:409
And they're talking swap meets
and boat basins.

783
00:44:49,674 --> 00:44:54,247  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
The old lady at the end of the table
is a classic Jew-hater.

784
00:44:54,315 --> 00:44:58,757  X1:146 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
They really look American, healthy,
like they never get sick or anything.

785
00:44:58,827 --> 00:45:01,894  X1:178 X2:543 Y1:334 Y2:409
Nothing like my family.
The two are like oil and water.

786
00:45:02,253 --> 00:45:05,036  X1:211 X2:511 Y1:334 Y2:409
Ah, let him drop dead.
Who needs his business?

787
00:45:05,101 --> 00:45:10,504  X1:175 X2:547 Y1:334 Y2:409
- His wife has diabetes.
- Diabetes? ls that an excuse?

788
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:14,799  X1:149 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
The man is 50 years old
and doesn't have a substantial job.

789
00:45:14,864 --> 00:45:16,523  X1:214 X2:507 Y1:334 Y2:409
ls that a reason to steal
from your partner?

790
00:45:16,593 --> 00:45:18,960  X1:233 X2:488 Y1:334 Y2:409
You don't know what
you're talking about.

791
00:45:19,025 --> 00:45:20,619  X1:288 X2:433 Y1:374 Y2:410
Defend him!

792
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:23,243  X1:257 X2:464 Y1:374 Y2:410
Pass the brisket.

793
00:45:23,314 --> 00:45:25,770  X1:247 X2:474 Y1:334 Y2:409
Mo Moskowitz.
He had a coronary.

794
00:45:25,843 --> 00:45:27,698  X1:275 X2:446 Y1:374 Y2:410
You don't say!

795
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,799  X1:129 X2:593 Y1:334 Y2:409
How do you plan to spend the holidays,
Mrs. Singer?

796
00:45:30,868 --> 00:45:32,843  X1:299 X2:423 Y1:334 Y2:409
- We fast.
- Fast?

797
00:45:32,917 --> 00:45:36,049  X1:168 X2:554 Y1:334 Y2:409
No food.
You know, to atone for our sins.

798
00:45:36,118 --> 00:45:38,126  X1:247 X2:474 Y1:334 Y2:409
What sins?
l don't understand.

799
00:45:38,198 --> 00:45:39,987  X1:272 X2:449 Y1:374 Y2:410
Neither do we.

800
00:45:41,976 --> 00:45:44,627  X1:207 X2:515 Y1:374 Y2:410
Hi, Duane. How's it going?

801
00:45:44,696 --> 00:45:48,560  X1:219 X2:503 Y1:334 Y2:409
- This is my room.
- Oh, yeah? lt's terrific.

802
00:45:48,633 --> 00:45:50,543  X1:202 X2:519 Y1:374 Y2:410
Can l confess something?

803
00:45:55,803 --> 00:45:58,935  X1:147 X2:574 Y1:334 Y2:409
l tell you this, because, as an artist,
l think you'll understand.

804
00:46:01,789 --> 00:46:04,659  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:374 Y2:410
Sometimes when l'm driving...

805
00:46:04,733 --> 00:46:06,621  X1:232 X2:490 Y1:374 Y2:410
on the road at night...

806
00:46:06,687 --> 00:46:10,004  X1:210 X2:512 Y1:334 Y2:409
l see two headlights
coming toward me, fast.

807
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,382  X1:203 X2:519 Y1:334 Y2:409
l have this impulse
to turn the wheel quickly...

808
00:46:12,448 --> 00:46:14,620  X1:174 X2:548 Y1:374 Y2:410
head-on into the oncoming car.

809
00:46:15,712 --> 00:46:17,818  X1:180 X2:541 Y1:374 Y2:410
l can anticipate the explosion.

810
00:46:17,889 --> 00:46:21,884  X1:175 X2:546 Y1:374 Y2:410
The sound of shattering glass.

811
00:46:21,954 --> 00:46:26,178  X1:217 X2:505 Y1:334 Y2:409
The flames rising out
of the flowing gasoline.

812
00:46:28,772 --> 00:46:30,147  X1:324 X2:397 Y1:374 Y2:410
Right.

813
00:46:31,461 --> 00:46:36,962  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
l have to go now, Duane, because
l'm due back on the planet Earth.

814
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,885  X1:204 X2:518 Y1:374 Y2:410
Don't let it be so long now.

815
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:42,432  X1:185 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Look up Uncle Billy, promise.
- He is adorable.

816
00:46:42,504 --> 00:46:44,871  X1:132 X2:590 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You'll take them to the airport now?
- No. Duane can.

817
00:46:44,937 --> 00:46:47,588  X1:192 X2:529 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l haven't finished my drink.
- Yes, Duane is. l'll be right--

818
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:08,682  X1:256 X2:466 Y1:334 Y2:409
You followed me.
l can't believe it!

819
00:47:08,751 --> 00:47:10,639  X1:244 X2:478 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l didn't follow you.
- You followed me!

820
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:14,087  X1:137 X2:584 Y1:334 Y2:409
Because l was walking a block behind
staring at you? That's not following.

821
00:47:14,161 --> 00:47:17,675  X1:123 X2:599 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What's your definition of "following"?
- Following is different. l was spying.

822
00:47:17,746 --> 00:47:19,175  X1:220 X2:501 Y1:334 Y2:409
Do you realize
how paranoid you are?

823
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:22,185  X1:120 X2:601 Y1:334 Y2:409
Paranoid? l'm looking at you, and you've
got your arms around another guy.

824
00:47:22,258 --> 00:47:24,168  X1:151 X2:571 Y1:374 Y2:410
That is the worst kind of paranoid!

825
00:47:24,243 --> 00:47:27,473  X1:130 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
l didn't start out spying. l thought l'd
surprise you, pick you up after school.

826
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:31,250  X1:135 X2:586 Y1:334 Y2:409
You wanted to keep the relationship
flexible, remember? lt's your phrase.

827
00:47:31,317 --> 00:47:33,292  X1:188 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're having an affair
with your college professor!

828
00:47:33,366 --> 00:47:37,840  X1:112 X2:610 Y1:334 Y2:409
That jerk that teaches that crap course,
"Contemporary Crisis in Western Man."

829
00:47:37,911 --> 00:47:40,562  X1:171 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
"Existential Motifs in Russian
Literature." You're really close.

830
00:47:40,632 --> 00:47:42,803  X1:190 X2:532 Y1:334 Y2:409
What's the difference?
lt's all mental masturbation.

831
00:47:42,872 --> 00:47:45,393  X1:171 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
Now we're getting to a subject
you know something about.

832
00:47:45,465 --> 00:47:48,313  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:334 Y2:409
Don't knock masturbation.
lt's sex with someone l love.

833
00:47:48,378 --> 00:47:52,918  X1:133 X2:589 Y1:334 Y2:409
We're not having an affair. He's
married. He happens to think l'm neat.

834
00:47:52,986 --> 00:47:55,954  X1:140 X2:581 Y1:334 Y2:409
Are you 12 years old? That's one
of your Chippewa Falls expressions.

835
00:47:56,027 --> 00:47:57,719  X1:287 X2:435 Y1:374 Y2:410
Who cares?

836
00:47:57,788 --> 00:48:01,302  X1:130 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
Next he'll find you're keen and peachy.
Then he'll have his hand on your ass.

837
00:48:01,374 --> 00:48:04,276  X1:149 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
You've had hostility towards David
ever since l mentioned him.

838
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:06,423  X1:178 X2:544 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You call your teacher David?
- lt's his name.

839
00:48:06,494 --> 00:48:09,943  X1:188 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's a Biblical name, right?
Does he call you Bathsheba?

840
00:48:10,016 --> 00:48:14,010  X1:125 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
Alvy, you're the one who never wanted
to make a real commitment.

841
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,016  X1:144 X2:578 Y1:334 Y2:409
You don't think l'm smart enough.
We had that argument last month...

842
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:19,708  X1:157 X2:565 Y1:374 Y2:410
or don't you remember that day?

843
00:48:21,123 --> 00:48:23,741  X1:277 X2:445 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm home!
- How'd it go?

844
00:48:23,812 --> 00:48:26,660  X1:187 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt was really weird,
but she's a very nice woman.

845
00:48:26,724 --> 00:48:30,238  X1:175 X2:547 Y1:334 Y2:409
l didn't have to lie on the couch.
She had me sitting up.

846
00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:34,052  X1:172 X2:550 Y1:334 Y2:409
l told her about the family
and my feelings towards men...

847
00:48:34,118 --> 00:48:36,191  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:374 Y2:410
and my relationship with my brother.

848
00:48:36,262 --> 00:48:38,881  X1:170 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
Then she mentioned penis envy.
Do you know about that?

849
00:48:38,951 --> 00:48:43,076  X1:177 X2:544 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm one of the few males
who suffers from that. Go on.

850
00:48:43,144 --> 00:48:47,488  X1:124 X2:598 Y1:334 Y2:409
She said l was guilty about my impulses
towards marriage and children.

851
00:48:47,562 --> 00:48:51,971  X1:107 X2:614 Y1:334 Y2:409
Then, l remembered, when l was a kid, l
accidentally saw my parents making love.

852
00:48:52,043 --> 00:48:54,465  X1:162 X2:559 Y1:334 Y2:409
All this happened the first hour?
That's amazing.

853
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:58,021  X1:187 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
l've been going for 15 years.
l don't have nothing like that.

854
00:48:58,092 --> 00:49:00,264  X1:241 X2:481 Y1:334 Y2:409
l told her my dream,
and then l cried.

855
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:03,716  X1:170 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
You cried. l've never once cried.
That's fantastic to me.

856
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:05,863  X1:267 X2:455 Y1:334 Y2:409
l whine.
l sit and l whine.

857
00:49:05,934 --> 00:49:09,645  X1:139 X2:582 Y1:334 Y2:409
ln my dream, Frank Sinatra is holding
this pillow across my face...

858
00:49:09,711 --> 00:49:11,566  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:374 Y2:410
and l can't breathe.

859
00:49:11,632 --> 00:49:13,771  X1:245 X2:477 Y1:374 Y2:410
He's strangling me.

860
00:49:13,841 --> 00:49:16,624  X1:166 X2:555 Y1:334 Y2:409
Sure, because he's a singer,
and you're a singer. lt's perfect.

861
00:49:16,689 --> 00:49:19,537  X1:140 X2:581 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're trying to suffocate yourself.
lt makes perfect sense.

862
00:49:19,603 --> 00:49:21,840  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:374 Y2:410
That's a perfect analytic insight.

863
00:49:21,907 --> 00:49:25,355  X1:140 X2:582 Y1:374 Y2:410
She said your name was Alvy Singer.

864
00:49:25,427 --> 00:49:27,337  X1:208 X2:513 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What do you mean, me?
- Yeah, you.

865
00:49:27,412 --> 00:49:30,479  X1:207 X2:515 Y1:334 Y2:409
Because in the dream,
l break Sinatra's glasses.

866
00:49:30,549 --> 00:49:35,057  X1:141 X2:581 Y1:334 Y2:409
You never said Sinatra had glasses.
Are you saying l'm suffocating you?

867
00:49:35,126 --> 00:49:38,291  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
God, l did this really terrible thing
to him...

868
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:42,801  X1:155 X2:566 Y1:334 Y2:409
because then when he sang,
it was in this real high-pitch voice.

869
00:49:42,872 --> 00:49:46,419  X1:158 X2:563 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What'd the doctor say?
- l should come five times a week.

870
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:51,576  X1:125 X2:597 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't think l mind analysis at all.
The question is, will it change my wife?

871
00:49:51,643 --> 00:49:54,197  X1:203 X2:519 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Will it change your wife?
- Will it change my life?

872
00:49:54,268 --> 00:49:57,618  X1:235 X2:487 Y1:334 Y2:409
- But you said "wife."
- No, l said "life."

873
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,60  X1:236 X2:486 Y1:334 Y2:409
- No, you said "wife."
- "Life!" l said "life."

874
00:50:01,67 --> 00:50:03,290  X1:127 X2:595 Y1:334 Y2:409
She said "wife." You heard that,
because you were there. l'm not crazy.

875
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:07,101  X1:178 X2:543 Y1:334 Y2:409
Then l told her l didn't think
you'd ever take me seriously...

876
00:50:07,167 --> 00:50:09,502  X1:218 X2:503 Y1:334 Y2:409
because you don't think
l'm smart enough.

877
00:50:09,568 --> 00:50:13,562  X1:118 X2:604 Y1:334 Y2:409
Why do you bring that up? Because l
encourage you to take adult education?

878
00:50:13,633 --> 00:50:17,082  X1:146 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's a wonderful thing. You meet
wonderful, interesting professors.

879
00:50:17,218 --> 00:50:20,994  X1:121 X2:600 Y1:334 Y2:409
Adult education is junk. The professors
are phony. How can you do it?

880
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:23,810  X1:131 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't care what you say about David.
He's a fine teacher.

881
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:28,449  X1:125 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
And why are you following me around?
We should call this relationship quits.

882
00:50:28,517 --> 00:50:31,485  X1:183 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's fine. That's great.
l don't know what l did wrong.

883
00:50:31,558 --> 00:50:35,236  X1:156 X2:565 Y1:334 Y2:409
Somewhere she cooled off to me.
ls it something that l did?

884
00:50:35,303 --> 00:50:38,620  X1:147 X2:574 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's never something you do.
That's how people are. Love fades.

885
00:50:38,696 --> 00:50:41,544  X1:157 X2:565 Y1:334 Y2:409
Love fades.
God, that's a depressing thought.

886
00:50:41,608 --> 00:50:43,780  X1:191 X2:531 Y1:334 Y2:409
l have to ask you a question.
Don't go any further.

887
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:47,199  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
With your wife, in bed, does she need
some kind of artificial stimulation...

888
00:50:47,274 --> 00:50:49,347  X1:265 X2:456 Y1:374 Y2:410
like marijuana?

889
00:50:49,419 --> 00:50:51,940  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:374 Y2:410
We use a large vibrating egg.

890
00:50:52,011 --> 00:50:53,800  X1:227 X2:494 Y1:374 Y2:410
A large vibrating egg.

891
00:50:53,867 --> 00:50:57,730  X1:166 X2:555 Y1:334 Y2:409
l ask a psychopath,
l get that kind of answer. Jesus!

892
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:00,708  X1:159 X2:563 Y1:374 Y2:410
You look like a very happy couple.

893
00:51:00,782 --> 00:51:02,921  X1:296 X2:426 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Are you?
- Yeah.

894
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:05,358  X1:197 X2:525 Y1:374 Y2:410
How do you account for it?

895
00:51:05,423 --> 00:51:09,199  X1:193 X2:529 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm very shallow and empty,
and l have no ideas...

896
00:51:09,264 --> 00:51:11,403  X1:175 X2:546 Y1:374 Y2:410
and nothing interesting to say.

897
00:51:11,472 --> 00:51:14,637  X1:196 X2:525 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm exactly the same way.
- l see.

898
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:17,575  X1:155 X2:567 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's interesting. So you've
managed to work out something?

899
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:19,025  X1:324 X2:397 Y1:374 Y2:410
Right.

900
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:21,774  X1:208 X2:513 Y1:374 Y2:410
Thanks for talking to me.

901
00:51:21,843 --> 00:51:25,641  X1:151 X2:570 Y1:334 Y2:409
Even as a kid, l went for the wrong
women. l think that's my problem.

902
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:27,789  X1:207 X2:515 Y1:334 Y2:409
When my mother took me
to see Snow White...

903
00:51:27,861 --> 00:51:32,139  X1:132 X2:590 Y1:334 Y2:409
everyone fell in love with Snow White,
and l fell for the wicked queen.

904
00:51:32,277 --> 00:51:35,410  X1:154 X2:567 Y1:334 Y2:409
- We never have any fun anymore.
- How can you say that?

905
00:51:35,479 --> 00:51:37,901  X1:161 X2:560 Y1:334 Y2:409
Why not? You're always
leaning on me to improve myself.

906
00:51:37,976 --> 00:51:40,246  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're upset. You must be
getting your period.

907
00:51:40,313 --> 00:51:44,821  X1:119 X2:603 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't get a period. l'm a cartoon
character. Can't l be upset sometimes?

908
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:48,633  X1:149 X2:572 Y1:334 Y2:409
Max, forget about Annie.
l know lots of women you can date.

909
00:51:48,699 --> 00:51:50,641  X1:232 X2:490 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't want to go out
with other women.

910
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:53,621  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:300 Y2:419
Max, l've got a girl for you.
You are going to love her.
She's a reporter for Rolling Stone.

911
00:51:56,092 --> 00:51:58,002  X1:191 X2:531 Y1:334 Y2:409
There are more people here
to see the Maharishi...

912
00:51:58,077 --> 00:52:00,631  X1:209 X2:512 Y1:334 Y2:409
than there were
to see the Dylan concert.

913
00:52:00,702 --> 00:52:03,769  X1:191 X2:531 Y1:334 Y2:409
l covered the Dylan concert,
which gave me chills.

914
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:08,990  X1:177 X2:544 Y1:334 Y2:409
Especially when he sang,
"She takes just like a woman...

915
00:52:09,056 --> 00:52:11,839  X1:242 X2:479 Y1:334 Y2:409
and she makes love
just like a woman.

916
00:52:11,904 --> 00:52:13,792  X1:274 X2:448 Y1:374 Y2:410
Yes, she does.

917
00:52:13,857 --> 00:52:17,022  X1:155 X2:566 Y1:374 Y2:410
And she aches just like a woman...

918
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:20,255  X1:240 X2:482 Y1:334 Y2:409
but she breaks
just like a little girl."

919
00:52:20,323 --> 00:52:23,171  X1:181 X2:540 Y1:334 Y2:409
Up to that, the most
charismatic event l covered...

920
00:52:23,236 --> 00:52:25,757  X1:136 X2:585 Y1:334 Y2:409
was Mick's birthday when the Stones
played Madison Square Garden.

921
00:52:25,828 --> 00:52:27,389  X1:252 X2:469 Y1:374 Y2:410
That's just great.

922
00:52:27,461 --> 00:52:29,534  X1:254 X2:467 Y1:374 Y2:410
You catch Dylan?

923
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:32,770  X1:204 X2:517 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, l couldn't make it.
My raccoon had hepatitis.

924
00:52:32,838 --> 00:52:34,694  X1:232 X2:489 Y1:374 Y2:410
You have a raccoon?

925
00:52:34,759 --> 00:52:36,133  X1:319 X2:403 Y1:374 Y2:410
A few.

926
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:38,982  X1:227 X2:494 Y1:334 Y2:409
The only word for this
is "transplendent."

927
00:52:39,048 --> 00:52:42,660  X1:186 X2:536 Y1:334 Y2:409
- lt's transplendent.
- l can think of another word.

928
00:52:42,729 --> 00:52:45,250  X1:221 X2:501 Y1:334 Y2:409
He's God.
l mean, this man is God.

929
00:52:45,322 --> 00:52:47,940  X1:144 X2:578 Y1:334 Y2:409
He's got millions of followers,
who would crawl across the world...

930
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:49,898  X1:216 X2:506 Y1:334 Y2:409
just to touch
the hem of his garment.

931
00:52:49,963 --> 00:52:51,818  X1:182 X2:540 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt must be a tremendous hem.

932
00:52:51,883 --> 00:52:54,634  X1:203 X2:519 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm a Rosicrucian myself.
- Are you?

933
00:52:54,701 --> 00:52:58,728  X1:127 X2:595 Y1:334 Y2:409
l can't get with any religion that
advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look.

934
00:52:58,798 --> 00:53:01,002  X1:218 X2:504 Y1:334 Y2:409
There's God coming out
of the men's room.

935
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:03,689  X1:170 X2:552 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's unbelievably transplendent!

936
00:53:03,758 --> 00:53:06,858  X1:129 X2:592 Y1:334 Y2:409
l was at the Stones' concert
when they killed that guy. Remember?

937
00:53:06,928 --> 00:53:09,863  X1:170 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
Were you?
l was at an Alice Cooper thing...

938
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:13,036  X1:178 X2:543 Y1:334 Y2:409
where six people were rushed
to the hospital with bad vibes.

939
00:53:14,033 --> 00:53:16,368  X1:196 X2:525 Y1:334 Y2:409
l hope you don't mind
that l took so long to finish.

940
00:53:16,435 --> 00:53:19,403  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:374 Y2:410
Me? No. Don't be silly.

941
00:53:21,011 --> 00:53:24,787  X1:168 X2:553 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm starting to get some feeling
back in my jaw now.

942
00:53:25,877 --> 00:53:29,173  X1:199 X2:522 Y1:334 Y2:409
Sex with you is really
a Kafkaesque experience.

943
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,208  X1:296 X2:426 Y1:374 Y2:410
Thank you.

944
00:53:32,278 --> 00:53:34,646  X1:187 X2:535 Y1:374 Y2:410
l mean that as a compliment.

945
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:38,935  X1:175 X2:547 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think there's too much burden
placed on the orgasm...

946
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,165  X1:189 X2:533 Y1:334 Y2:409
to make up for empty areas
in life.

947
00:53:43,897 --> 00:53:45,785  X1:267 X2:454 Y1:374 Y2:410
Who said that?

948
00:53:48,411 --> 00:53:51,129  X1:147 X2:574 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know. l think
it may have been Leopold and Loeb.

949
00:53:55,965 --> 00:53:57,340  X1:328 X2:394 Y1:374 Y2:410
Hello.

950
00:54:02,207 --> 00:54:05,306  X1:216 X2:505 Y1:374 Y2:410
No. What's the matter?

951
00:54:06,848 --> 00:54:09,401  X1:246 X2:476 Y1:374 Y2:410
You sound terrible.

952
00:54:09,472 --> 00:54:11,742  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:374 Y2:410
No, what-- Sure, l--

953
00:54:11,809 --> 00:54:13,948  X1:203 X2:518 Y1:374 Y2:410
What kind of emergency?

954
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:17,663  X1:218 X2:504 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, stay there.
l'll come over right now.

955
00:54:17,731 --> 00:54:19,935  X1:246 X2:476 Y1:334 Y2:409
Just stay there.
l'll come right over.

956
00:54:20,068 --> 00:54:22,370  X1:262 X2:460 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's me. Open up.
Are you okay?

957
00:54:22,436 --> 00:54:24,925  X1:238 X2:483 Y1:334 Y2:409
What's the matter?
Are you all right?

958
00:54:24,997 --> 00:54:27,266  X1:160 X2:561 Y1:374 Y2:410
There's a spider in the bathroom.

959
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:30,913  X1:131 X2:590 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What?
- There's a big spider in the bathroom.

960
00:54:32,551 --> 00:54:36,349  X1:151 X2:570 Y1:334 Y2:409
You got me here at 3:00 a.m.
'cause a spider's in the bathroom?

961
00:54:36,424 --> 00:54:40,702  X1:119 X2:603 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know how l am about insects. l can't
sleep with that thing crawling around.

962
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:43,167  X1:213 X2:509 Y1:334 Y2:409
Kill it!
What's wrong with you?

963
00:54:43,242 --> 00:54:46,177  X1:159 X2:562 Y1:374 Y2:410
Don't you have Raid in the house?

964
00:54:46,251 --> 00:54:50,922  X1:186 X2:536 Y1:334 Y2:409
l told you a thousand times
to keep a lot of insect spray.

965
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:53,258  X1:133 X2:588 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You never know who will crawl over.
- l know.

966
00:54:53,325 --> 00:54:55,365  X1:230 X2:492 Y1:334 Y2:409
And a first aid kit
and fire extinguisher.

967
00:54:55,437 --> 00:54:57,805  X1:224 X2:498 Y1:334 Y2:409
Give me a magazine,
'cause l'm a little tired.

968
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:00,969  X1:177 X2:544 Y1:334 Y2:409
You make fun of me,
but l'm prepared for anything.

969
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:03,657  X1:188 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
An emergency, a tidal wave,
an earthquake.

970
00:55:04,463 --> 00:55:07,813  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:334 Y2:409
What is this?
Did you go to a rock concert?

971
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:09,263  X1:325 X2:396 Y1:374 Y2:410
Yeah.

972
00:55:09,329 --> 00:55:12,843  X1:256 X2:466 Y1:334 Y2:409
Really?
How'd you like it?

973
00:55:12,914 --> 00:55:16,941  X1:190 X2:531 Y1:334 Y2:409
Was it heavy? Did it achieve
total "heavyosity"?

974
00:55:17,011 --> 00:55:19,313  X1:254 X2:468 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt was just great!

975
00:55:19,379 --> 00:55:22,609  X1:151 X2:570 Y1:334 Y2:409
l've got an idea. Call the guy
who took you to the rock concert...

976
00:55:22,677 --> 00:55:25,011  X1:149 X2:572 Y1:374 Y2:410
and he can come and kill the spider.

977
00:55:25,077 --> 00:55:27,598  X1:189 X2:532 Y1:334 Y2:409
l called you.
You want to help me or not?

978
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:31,282  X1:142 X2:580 Y1:334 Y2:409
Since when do you read the National
Review? What are you turning into?

979
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:34,385  X1:185 X2:537 Y1:374 Y2:410
l like to get all points of view.

980
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:37,107  X1:160 X2:562 Y1:334 Y2:409
Wonderful. Get William F. Buckley
to kill the spider.

981
00:55:37,176 --> 00:55:40,079  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're a little hostile,
you know that?

982
00:55:40,153 --> 00:55:42,969  X1:225 X2:497 Y1:334 Y2:409
Not only that,
you look thin and tired.

983
00:55:43,034 --> 00:55:46,198  X1:219 X2:502 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's 3:00 in the morning.
You got me out of bed.

984
00:55:46,267 --> 00:55:49,235  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:334 Y2:409
l ran over. l couldn't get a taxi.
You said it was an emergency.

985
00:55:49,308 --> 00:55:51,283  X1:250 X2:471 Y1:374 Y2:410
l ran up the stairs.

986
00:55:51,356 --> 00:55:54,553  X1:211 X2:511 Y1:334 Y2:409
l was more attractive
when the evening began.

987
00:55:54,621 --> 00:55:57,469  X1:164 X2:558 Y1:334 Y2:409
Are you going with
a right-wing rock-and-roll star?

988
00:55:57,533 --> 00:56:00,251  X1:201 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
Would you like
a glass of chocolate milk?

989
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:04,891  X1:119 X2:602 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What am l, your son? l came over for--
- l've got the good chocolate.

990
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,775  X1:229 X2:493 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Where's the spider?
- lt's in the bathroom.

991
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,671  X1:175 X2:547 Y1:334 Y2:409
Don't squish it. After it's dead,
flush it down the toilet, okay?

992
00:56:11,746 --> 00:56:15,042  X1:222 X2:500 Y1:334 Y2:409
l've been killing spiders
since l was 30. Okay?

993
00:56:19,396 --> 00:56:22,943  X1:144 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's a very big spider.
A lot of trouble. There's two of 'em.

994
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:25,348  X1:194 X2:528 Y1:334 Y2:409
l didn't think it was that big,
but it's a major spider.

995
00:56:25,413 --> 00:56:29,920  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You got a broom or snow shovel?
- l left it at your house. l'm sorry.

996
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:31,846  X1:235 X2:487 Y1:374 Y2:410
What are you doing?

997
00:56:31,911 --> 00:56:34,400  X1:156 X2:565 Y1:334 Y2:409
There's a spider in your bathroom
the size of a Buick.

998
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:45,862  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You got black soap?
- lt's for my complexion.

999
00:56:45,931 --> 00:56:48,932  X1:162 X2:559 Y1:374 Y2:410
Are you joining a minstrel show?

1000
00:56:56,301 --> 00:56:57,676  X1:285 X2:437 Y1:374 Y2:410
Don't worry.

1001
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,165  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:334 Y2:409
l did it. l killed them both.
What's the matter?

1002
00:57:09,233 --> 00:57:13,544  X1:106 X2:616 Y1:334 Y2:409
What are you sad about? Did you want me
to capture and rehabilitate 'em?

1003
00:57:13,618 --> 00:57:16,619  X1:233 X2:489 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Don't go, please.
- What do you mean?

1004
00:57:16,691 --> 00:57:19,888  X1:184 X2:538 Y1:334 Y2:409
What's the matter?
Are you expecting termites?

1005
00:57:19,956 --> 00:57:22,127  X1:238 X2:483 Y1:374 Y2:410
What's the matter?

1006
00:57:22,197 --> 00:57:24,783  X1:222 X2:499 Y1:374 Y2:410
l don't know. l miss you.

1007
00:57:24,853 --> 00:57:27,537  X1:273 X2:448 Y1:374 Y2:410
Jesus! Really?

1008
00:57:34,168 --> 00:57:36,307  X1:310 X2:411 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Alvy?
- What?

1009
00:57:37,848 --> 00:57:41,744  X1:154 X2:567 Y1:334 Y2:409
Was there somebody in your room
when l called you?

1010
00:57:41,818 --> 00:57:45,300  X1:160 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What do you mean?
- l mean, l thought l heard a voice.

1011
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:49,234  X1:176 X2:546 Y1:334 Y2:409
l had the radio on.
l'm sorry, it was the television.

1012
00:57:54,941 --> 00:58:01,54  X1:196 X2:526 Y1:334 Y2:409
Let's never break up again.
l don't want to be apart.

1013
00:58:01,61 --> 00:58:04,089  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think we're both much too mature
for something like that.

1014
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,878  X1:148 X2:574 Y1:334 Y2:409
Living together hasn't been so bad,
has it?

1015
00:58:06,945 --> 00:58:10,012  X1:214 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
For me it's been terrific.
You know?

1016
00:58:10,081 --> 00:58:12,537  X1:141 X2:580 Y1:374 Y2:410
Better than either of my marriages.

1017
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:16,801  X1:121 X2:601 Y1:334 Y2:409
There's something different about you.
l don't know what, but it's great.

1018
00:58:16,867 --> 00:58:22,270  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think, if you let me,
l could help you have more fun.

1019
00:58:22,341 --> 00:58:25,309  X1:229 X2:492 Y1:374 Y2:410
l know it's hard. Yeah.

1020
00:58:25,382 --> 00:58:28,896  X1:147 X2:574 Y1:374 Y2:410
What if we go away this weekend?

1021
00:58:28,967 --> 00:58:32,383  X1:141 X2:580 Y1:334 Y2:409
Why don't we get Rob, and the three
of us would drive into Brooklyn?

1022
00:58:32,456 --> 00:58:35,009  X1:115 X2:607 Y1:334 Y2:409
We could show you the old neighborhood.
That'd be fun for you.

1023
00:58:35,081 --> 00:58:37,088  X1:266 X2:455 Y1:374 Y2:410
Yeah, l'd love it.

1024
00:58:38,025 --> 00:58:40,197  X1:234 X2:488 Y1:374 Y2:410
God, it's a great day!

1025
00:58:40,265 --> 00:58:43,878  X1:245 X2:477 Y1:334 Y2:409
Watch the road!
You'll total the car!

1026
00:58:43,946 --> 00:58:45,987  X1:194 X2:527 Y1:374 Y2:410
l've never been to Brooklyn.

1027
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,548  X1:133 X2:589 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l can't wait to see the neighborhood.
- The neighborhood will be great.

1028
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:51,719  X1:144 X2:578 Y1:334 Y2:409
- We could show her the schoolyard.
- l was a great athlete. Tell her.

1029
00:58:51,789 --> 00:58:54,342  X1:236 X2:486 Y1:374 Y2:410
l was all-schoolyard.

1030
00:58:54,413 --> 00:58:57,448  X1:170 X2:552 Y1:334 Y2:409
They threw him a football once.
He tried to dribble it.

1031
00:58:57,518 --> 00:58:59,046  X1:259 X2:462 Y1:334 Y2:409
l used to lose
my glasses a lot.

1032
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:02,633  X1:200 X2:522 Y1:334 Y2:409
Look! That's my old house.
That's where l used to live.

1033
00:59:02,703 --> 00:59:04,078  X1:303 X2:418 Y1:374 Y2:410
Holy cow!

1034
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,201  X1:119 X2:603 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're lucky. Where l used to live
is now a pornographic equipment store.

1035
00:59:08,273 --> 00:59:10,412  X1:227 X2:495 Y1:334 Y2:409
l had some very
good memories there.

1036
00:59:10,481 --> 00:59:13,449  X1:150 X2:572 Y1:334 Y2:409
What good memories, your mother
and father fighting all the time?

1037
00:59:13,522 --> 00:59:15,978  X1:143 X2:578 Y1:374 Y2:410
And over the most ridiculous things.

1038
00:59:16,115 --> 00:59:18,538  X1:163 X2:558 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You fired the cleaning woman?
- She was stealing!

1039
00:59:18,613 --> 00:59:21,035  X1:160 X2:562 Y1:334 Y2:409
But she's colored.
The colored have enough trouble!

1040
00:59:21,109 --> 00:59:23,531  X1:152 X2:569 Y1:334 Y2:409
- She was going through my purse.
- They're persecuted enough.

1041
00:59:23,606 --> 00:59:27,436  X1:169 X2:553 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Who's persecuting? She stole!
- So? We can afford it.

1042
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:30,707  X1:146 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
How can we afford it, on your pay?
What if she steals more?

1043
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:33,743  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
She's a colored woman from Harlem.
She has no money.

1044
00:59:33,816 --> 00:59:37,592  X1:122 X2:599 Y1:334 Y2:409
She has a right to steal from us.
Who can she steal from if not from us?

1045
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,178  X1:231 X2:491 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You're both crazy.
- They can't hear you.

1046
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:42,836  X1:236 X2:485 Y1:374 Y2:410
Leo, l married a fool!

1047
00:59:42,907 --> 00:59:44,663  X1:279 X2:443 Y1:374 Y2:410
What's that?

1048
00:59:44,731 --> 00:59:49,948  X1:125 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's the welcome home party, 1945,
for my cousin Herbie.

1049
00:59:52,574 --> 00:59:55,870  X1:229 X2:493 Y1:334 Y2:409
Look. That over there
is Joey Nichols.

1050
00:59:55,934 --> 00:59:58,488  X1:130 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
He was my father's friend. He was
always bothering me when l was a kid.

1051
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,374  X1:279 X2:442 Y1:334 Y2:409
Joey Nichols.
See? Nickels.

1052
01:00:01,439 --> 01:00:04,604  X1:254 X2:467 Y1:334 Y2:409
See? Nickels.
You see? Nickels.

1053
01:00:04,672 --> 01:00:09,529  X1:139 X2:582 Y1:334 Y2:409
You can always remember my name.
Just think of Joey Five-Cents.

1054
01:00:09,602 --> 01:00:13,400  X1:258 X2:464 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's me.
Joey Five-Cents.

1055
01:00:13,475 --> 01:00:15,002  X1:257 X2:465 Y1:374 Y2:410
What an asshole.

1056
01:00:15,075 --> 01:00:18,272  X1:168 X2:554 Y1:334 Y2:409
The one who killed me the most
was my mother's sister, Tessie.

1057
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:20,894  X1:199 X2:523 Y1:334 Y2:409
l was always the sister
with good common sense...

1058
01:00:20,965 --> 01:00:23,519  X1:174 X2:547 Y1:334 Y2:409
but Tessie was always the one
with personality.

1059
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:26,460  X1:164 X2:557 Y1:334 Y2:409
When she was younger,
they all wanted to marry Tessie.

1060
01:00:26,535 --> 01:00:29,219  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:334 Y2:409
Do you believe Tessie
had the personality?

1061
01:00:29,287 --> 01:00:32,998  X1:131 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
- She's the life of the ghetto no doubt.
- She was once a great beauty.

1062
01:00:33,064 --> 01:00:35,847  X1:141 X2:580 Y1:334 Y2:409
Tessie, they say you were the sister
with personality.

1063
01:00:35,913 --> 01:00:38,401  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:374 Y2:410
l was a great beauty!

1064
01:00:38,473 --> 01:00:42,336  X1:124 X2:597 Y1:334 Y2:409
- How did this personality come about?
- l was very charming.

1065
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:44,483  X1:226 X2:496 Y1:334 Y2:409
There were many men
interested in you?

1066
01:00:44,555 --> 01:00:48,200  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:374 Y2:410
l was quite a lively dancer.

1067
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:50,156  X1:214 X2:507 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's very hard to believe.

1068
01:00:50,252 --> 01:00:55,272  X1:123 X2:599 Y1:334 Y2:409
l had a really good day.
lt was a fine way to spend my birthday.

1069
01:00:55,343 --> 01:00:58,377  X1:143 X2:579 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Your birthday isn't until tomorrow.
- But it's real close.

1070
01:00:58,447 --> 01:01:00,684  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:374 Y2:410
But no presents until midnight.

1071
01:01:04,241 --> 01:01:05,616  X1:263 X2:458 Y1:374 Y2:410
Happy birthday.

1072
01:01:05,681 --> 01:01:08,682  X1:172 X2:550 Y1:334 Y2:409
What is this? ls this a present?
Are you kidding?

1073
01:01:08,753 --> 01:01:11,372  X1:181 X2:541 Y1:374 Y2:410
Yeah. Why don't you try it on?

1074
01:01:11,442 --> 01:01:15,786  X1:145 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
- This is more like a present for you.
- lt'll add ten years to our sex life.

1075
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:17,683  X1:266 X2:455 Y1:374 Y2:410
Yeah. Forget it.

1076
01:01:17,748 --> 01:01:20,334  X1:229 X2:493 Y1:374 Y2:410
Here's a real present.

1077
01:01:20,405 --> 01:01:23,275  X1:222 X2:500 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What is this anyway?
- Check it out.

1078
01:01:27,479 --> 01:01:31,310  X1:218 X2:504 Y1:334 Y2:409
You knew l wanted this.
God, it's terrific!

1079
01:01:31,384 --> 01:01:34,646  X1:137 X2:585 Y1:334 Y2:409
Just put on the watch and that thing.
lt'll be perfect.

1080
01:01:44,941 --> 01:01:48,717  X1:293 X2:428 Y1:374 Y2:410
Seems like

1081
01:01:48,782 --> 01:01:53,224  X1:300 X2:421 Y1:374 Y2:410
Old times

1082
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:57,894  X1:292 X2:430 Y1:374 Y2:410
Having you

1083
01:01:57,969 --> 01:02:00,588  X1:281 X2:441 Y1:374 Y2:410
To walk with

1084
01:02:00,657 --> 01:02:03,625  X1:293 X2:428 Y1:374 Y2:410
Seems like

1085
01:02:06,996 --> 01:02:11,120  X1:300 X2:421 Y1:374 Y2:410
Old times

1086
01:02:12,597 --> 01:02:16,722  X1:215 X2:507 Y1:374 Y2:410
Having you to walk with

1087
01:02:18,198 --> 01:02:23,284  X1:246 X2:476 Y1:374 Y2:410
And it's still a thrill

1088
01:02:23,352 --> 01:02:28,438  X1:227 X2:495 Y1:374 Y2:410
Just to have my arms

1089
01:02:28,505 --> 01:02:30,873  X1:288 X2:433 Y1:374 Y2:410
Around you

1090
01:02:33,914 --> 01:02:37,844  X1:281 X2:441 Y1:374 Y2:410
Still the thrill

1091
01:02:37,916 --> 01:02:41,746  X1:240 X2:481 Y1:374 Y2:410
That it was the day

1092
01:02:41,821 --> 01:02:45,171  X1:292 X2:430 Y1:374 Y2:410
l found you

1093
01:02:45,246 --> 01:02:50,648  X1:293 X2:428 Y1:374 Y2:410
Seems like

1094
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:55,031  X1:300 X2:421 Y1:374 Y2:410
Old times

1095
01:02:58,114 --> 01:03:03,134  X1:203 X2:518 Y1:374 Y2:410
Dinner dates and flowers

1096
01:03:05,507 --> 01:03:10,658  X1:300 X2:421 Y1:374 Y2:410
Old times

1097
01:03:12,101 --> 01:03:17,220  X1:239 X2:482 Y1:374 Y2:410
Staying up all hours

1098
01:03:17,286 --> 01:03:22,306  X1:200 X2:521 Y1:374 Y2:410
Making dreams come true

1099
01:03:23,624 --> 01:03:28,262  X1:230 X2:491 Y1:374 Y2:410
Doing things we used

1100
01:03:29,418 --> 01:03:32,680  X1:324 X2:397 Y1:374 Y2:410
To do

1101
01:03:34,539 --> 01:03:37,639  X1:293 X2:428 Y1:374 Y2:410
Seems like

1102
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:41,189  X1:300 X2:421 Y1:374 Y2:410
Old times

1103
01:03:45,262 --> 01:03:50,152  X1:299 X2:423 Y1:374 Y2:410
Here with

1104
01:03:52,016 --> 01:03:56,327  X1:334 X2:388 Y1:374 Y2:410
You

1105
01:04:02,739 --> 01:04:04,627  X1:296 X2:426 Y1:374 Y2:410
Thank you.

1106
01:04:04,724 --> 01:04:06,829  X1:225 X2:496 Y1:374 Y2:410
You were sensational.

1107
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:10,163  X1:202 X2:519 Y1:334 Y2:409
l told you if you stuck to it,
you would be great and--

1108
01:04:10,229 --> 01:04:12,270  X1:225 X2:496 Y1:374 Y2:410
You were sensational.

1109
01:04:12,373 --> 01:04:15,570  X1:142 X2:580 Y1:374 Y2:410
Yeah, they were a terrific audience.

1110
01:04:15,638 --> 01:04:19,087  X1:217 X2:505 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt makes it easy for me,
because l can be--

1111
01:04:19,159 --> 01:04:22,455  X1:252 X2:470 Y1:334 Y2:409
Excuse me.
Hi, l'm Tony Lacey.

1112
01:04:22,521 --> 01:04:27,126  X1:114 X2:608 Y1:334 Y2:409
- We wanted to say we enjoyed your set.
- Yeah? Really?

1113
01:04:27,193 --> 01:04:30,064  X1:184 X2:538 Y1:334 Y2:409
l thought it was very musical.
l liked it a lot.

1114
01:04:30,138 --> 01:04:32,179  X1:254 X2:468 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's really nice.
Thanks a lot.

1115
01:04:32,251 --> 01:04:36,114  X1:218 X2:503 Y1:334 Y2:409
Are you recording?
Are you with any label?

1116
01:04:36,188 --> 01:04:39,320  X1:252 X2:469 Y1:374 Y2:410
Me? No, not at all.

1117
01:04:39,389 --> 01:04:43,449  X1:173 X2:549 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'd like to talk to you about that
sometime if you get a chance.

1118
01:04:43,518 --> 01:04:46,683  X1:197 X2:525 Y1:374 Y2:410
Possibly working together.

1119
01:04:46,751 --> 01:04:51,225  X1:176 X2:546 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's nice. This is Alvy Singer.
Do you know Alvy?

1120
01:04:51,296 --> 01:04:55,323  X1:189 X2:532 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't, but l know your work.
l'm a big fan of yours.

1121
01:04:55,393 --> 01:04:59,420  X1:166 X2:555 Y1:374 Y2:410
This is Shawn, Bob and Petronia.

1122
01:05:02,019 --> 01:05:04,802  X1:167 X2:554 Y1:374 Y2:410
We're going back to the Pierre...

1123
01:05:04,868 --> 01:05:07,803  X1:180 X2:541 Y1:334 Y2:409
and we're going to meet
Jack and Angelica for a drink.

1124
01:05:07,876 --> 01:05:10,910  X1:227 X2:494 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf you'd like to come,
we'd love to have you.

1125
01:05:10,982 --> 01:05:14,463  X1:243 X2:479 Y1:334 Y2:409
We can sit and talk.
Not a big deal.

1126
01:05:14,534 --> 01:05:17,317  X1:199 X2:523 Y1:374 Y2:410
Just relax, be very mellow.

1127
01:05:17,383 --> 01:05:19,456  X1:176 X2:546 Y1:374 Y2:410
Remember we had that thing?

1128
01:05:19,528 --> 01:05:21,022  X1:285 X2:437 Y1:374 Y2:410
What thing?

1129
01:05:22,216 --> 01:05:24,518  X1:138 X2:584 Y1:374 Y2:410
Remember we discussed that thing?

1130
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:31,652  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:334 Y2:409
Oh, the thing!
Oh, the thing. Yeah.

1131
01:05:31,723 --> 01:05:35,914  X1:214 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
Well, if it's inconvenient,
that's fine, too.

1132
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:40,421  X1:146 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
We'll do it another time. lf you're on
the coast, we'll get together there.

1133
01:05:40,493 --> 01:05:42,982  X1:220 X2:502 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt was a wonderful set.
l really enjoyed it.

1134
01:05:43,054 --> 01:05:45,291  X1:231 X2:491 Y1:334 Y2:409
Nice to have met you.
Good night.

1135
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,968  X1:176 X2:545 Y1:334 Y2:409
What's the matter?
You want to go to that party?

1136
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:56,587  X1:213 X2:509 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know.
l thought it might be fun.

1137
01:05:56,658 --> 01:05:58,763  X1:217 X2:504 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt would be nice to meet
some new people.

1138
01:06:00,146 --> 01:06:04,655  X1:126 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't think l could take a mellow
evening. l don't respond well to mellow.

1139
01:06:04,723 --> 01:06:08,237  X1:248 X2:474 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf l get too mellow,
l ripen and rot.

1140
01:06:08,309 --> 01:06:11,538  X1:222 X2:499 Y1:334 Y2:409
- lt's not good for my--
- All right.

1141
01:06:11,606 --> 01:06:14,062  X1:155 X2:567 Y1:334 Y2:409
You don't want to go to the party.
What do you want to do?

1142
01:06:21,688 --> 01:06:25,137  X1:135 X2:587 Y1:334 Y2:409
That day in Brooklyn was the last day
l remember having a good time.

1143
01:06:25,209 --> 01:06:28,887  X1:135 X2:586 Y1:334 Y2:409
- We never have any laughs anymore.
- l've been moody and dissatisfied.

1144
01:06:28,955 --> 01:06:31,890  X1:144 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
- How often do you sleep together?
- Do you have sex often?

1145
01:06:31,963 --> 01:06:34,200  X1:197 X2:524 Y1:334 Y2:409
Hardly ever.
Maybe three times a week.

1146
01:06:34,268 --> 01:06:38,328  X1:126 X2:596 Y1:334 Y2:409
Constantly. l'd say three times a week.
Like the other night, Alvy wanted sex.

1147
01:06:38,397 --> 01:06:40,307  X1:190 X2:532 Y1:334 Y2:409
She would not sleep with me
the other night.

1148
01:06:40,382 --> 01:06:44,573  X1:147 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know. Six months ago l would
have done it just to please him.

1149
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:46,494  X1:252 X2:469 Y1:374 Y2:410
l tried everything.

1150
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:49,909  X1:233 X2:488 Y1:334 Y2:409
l put on soft music
and my red light bulb.

1151
01:06:49,984 --> 01:06:55,071  X1:161 X2:560 Y1:334 Y2:409
Since our discussions here, l feel
l have a right to my own feelings.

1152
01:06:55,138 --> 01:06:58,368  X1:153 X2:568 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think you would have been happy,
because l really asserted myself.

1153
01:06:58,435 --> 01:07:00,802  X1:192 X2:530 Y1:334 Y2:409
The incredible thing is,
l'm paying for her analysis...

1154
01:07:00,867 --> 01:07:03,551  X1:211 X2:511 Y1:334 Y2:409
she's making progress,
and l'm getting screwed.

1155
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:07,777  X1:185 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
l feel so guilty,
because Alvy is paying for it.

1156
01:07:07,844 --> 01:07:10,049  X1:219 X2:502 Y1:334 Y2:409
So l feel guilty
if l don't sleep with him.

1157
01:07:10,117 --> 01:07:13,828  X1:153 X2:568 Y1:334 Y2:409
But if l do sleep with him, it's like
l'm going against my own feelings.

1158
01:07:13,895 --> 01:07:17,824  X1:178 X2:543 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm not making any progress.
- l can't win.

1159
01:07:17,895 --> 01:07:19,968  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
Sometimes l think
l should live with a woman.

1160
01:07:20,104 --> 01:07:24,164  X1:143 X2:578 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't believe it.
You guys have never snorted coke?

1161
01:07:24,233 --> 01:07:28,260  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
l always wanted to try,
but Alvy's very down on it.

1162
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:31,812  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
Don't put it on me. l don't want to put
a wad of white powder in my nose.

1163
01:07:31,884 --> 01:07:33,739  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:374 Y2:410
There's the nasal membrane.

1164
01:07:33,804 --> 01:07:37,253  X1:132 X2:590 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You never want to try anything new.
- How can you say that?

1165
01:07:37,325 --> 01:07:41,930  X1:114 X2:607 Y1:334 Y2:409
l said you, l and that girl
from acting class should sleep together.

1166
01:07:41,999 --> 01:07:44,846  X1:187 X2:535 Y1:334 Y2:409
- That's sick.
- l know it's sick, but it's new.

1167
01:07:44,911 --> 01:07:47,497  X1:158 X2:563 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You didn't say it couldn't be sick.
- Come on, Alvy.

1168
01:07:48,592 --> 01:07:51,211  X1:184 X2:538 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Do your body a favor. Try it.
- lt'll be fun.

1169
01:07:51,281 --> 01:07:55,472  X1:165 X2:557 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm sure it's fun, 'cause the lncas
did it. They were a million laughs.

1170
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:57,840  X1:187 X2:535 Y1:334 Y2:409
For your own experience.
You want to write. Why not?

1171
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:01,737  X1:158 X2:564 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's great stuff, Alvy. A friend
just brought it in from California.

1172
01:08:01,812 --> 01:08:04,944  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
l didn't tell you.
We're going to California next week.

1173
01:08:05,012 --> 01:08:07,980  X1:180 X2:542 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's really a thrill, as you know.

1174
01:08:08,053 --> 01:08:12,277  X1:135 X2:586 Y1:334 Y2:409
On my agent's advice, l sold out
and am going to do a TV appearance.

1175
01:08:12,342 --> 01:08:14,709  X1:183 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's not it at all.
Alvy's giving an award on TV.

1176
01:08:14,775 --> 01:08:17,109  X1:194 X2:528 Y1:334 Y2:409
You act like you're violating
a moral issue.

1177
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:21,138  X1:113 X2:608 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's so phony. We have to leave New York
during Christmas. lt kills me.

1178
01:08:21,209 --> 01:08:26,578  X1:147 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
Listen, while you're in California,
could you score some coke for me?

1179
01:08:26,650 --> 01:08:31,572  X1:185 X2:536 Y1:334 Y2:409
Sure, be glad to. l'll just put it
in the hollow heel on my boot.

1180
01:08:31,643 --> 01:08:35,954  X1:206 X2:516 Y1:334 Y2:409
- How much is this stuff?
- About $2,000 an ounce.

1181
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:38,485  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
Really?
And what is the kick of it?

1182
01:08:49,056 --> 01:08:52,799  X1:135 X2:586 Y1:334 Y2:409
l've never been so relaxed
as l have been since l moved out here.

1183
01:08:52,865 --> 01:08:56,695  X1:196 X2:526 Y1:334 Y2:409
l want you to see my house.
l live next to Hugh Hefner.

1184
01:08:56,770 --> 01:09:00,765  X1:126 X2:595 Y1:334 Y2:409
And the women are like in Playboy,
but they can move their arms and legs.

1185
01:09:00,835 --> 01:09:04,350  X1:209 X2:513 Y1:334 Y2:409
l can't get over that
this is really Beverly Hills.

1186
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:07,323  X1:137 X2:585 Y1:334 Y2:409
The architecture is really consistent.
There's French next to Spanish...

1187
01:09:07,397 --> 01:09:09,853  X1:166 X2:555 Y1:374 Y2:410
next to Tudor next to Japanese.

1188
01:09:09,926 --> 01:09:11,781  X1:232 X2:489 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's so clean out here.

1189
01:09:11,846 --> 01:09:15,459  X1:109 X2:612 Y1:334 Y2:409
Because they don't throw garbage away.
They make it into TV shows.

1190
01:09:15,527 --> 01:09:19,903  X1:144 X2:578 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Give us a break. lt's Christmas.
- Can you believe this is Christmas?

1191
01:09:19,977 --> 01:09:23,490  X1:176 X2:546 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt was snowing and really gray
in New York.

1192
01:09:23,561 --> 01:09:26,083  X1:237 X2:484 Y1:334 Y2:409
Nice. Santa Claus
will have sun stroke.

1193
01:09:26,154 --> 01:09:29,352  X1:227 X2:494 Y1:334 Y2:409
Max, there's no crime,
there's no mugging.

1194
01:09:29,387 --> 01:09:31,428  X1:191 X2:531 Y1:374 Y2:410
There's no economic crime...

1195
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,534  X1:225 X2:497 Y1:334 Y2:409
but there's ritual,
religious cult murders.

1196
01:09:34,605 --> 01:09:36,547  X1:234 X2:488 Y1:334 Y2:409
There's wheat-germ
killers out here.

1197
01:09:36,621 --> 01:09:39,142  X1:179 X2:542 Y1:334 Y2:409
While you're out here,
l want you to see my TV show.

1198
01:09:39,213 --> 01:09:41,636  X1:207 X2:514 Y1:334 Y2:409
And we're invited
to a big Christmas party.

1199
01:09:52,305 --> 01:09:55,655  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:374 Y2:410
Charlie, give me a good laugh here.

1200
01:09:58,483 --> 01:10:00,425  X1:273 X2:448 Y1:374 Y2:410
A little bigger.

1201
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:03,021  X1:195 X2:527 Y1:334 Y2:409
Do you realize how immoral
this all is?

1202
01:10:03,092 --> 01:10:05,133  X1:242 X2:479 Y1:374 Y2:410
l've got a hit series.

1203
01:10:05,205 --> 01:10:07,115  X1:177 X2:544 Y1:374 Y2:410
But you're adding fake laughs.

1204
01:10:09,174 --> 01:10:11,990  X1:155 X2:566 Y1:374 Y2:410
Give me a tremendous laugh here.

1205
01:10:12,055 --> 01:10:14,062  X1:219 X2:502 Y1:334 Y2:409
We do the show live
in front of an audience.

1206
01:10:14,135 --> 01:10:16,274  X1:168 X2:553 Y1:334 Y2:409
But nobody laughs,
because the jokes aren't funny.

1207
01:10:16,344 --> 01:10:18,800  X1:140 X2:582 Y1:374 Y2:410
That's why this machine is dynamite.

1208
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:25,718  X1:164 X2:558 Y1:374 Y2:410
Give me a medium chuckle here...

1209
01:10:25,787 --> 01:10:28,657  X1:241 X2:481 Y1:374 Y2:410
and then a big hand.

1210
01:10:28,731 --> 01:10:31,482  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:374 Y2:410
ls there booing on that?

1211
01:10:31,548 --> 01:10:34,167  X1:266 X2:456 Y1:374 Y2:410
l don't feel well.

1212
01:10:34,237 --> 01:10:37,686  X1:230 X2:491 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What's the matter?
- l got very dizzy.

1213
01:10:37,757 --> 01:10:39,962  X1:283 X2:438 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l feel dizzy.
- Sit down.

1214
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:41,405  X1:321 X2:400 Y1:374 Y2:410
Jesus.

1215
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:45,119  X1:226 X2:496 Y1:334 Y2:409
You all right?
You want to lie down?

1216
01:10:45,184 --> 01:10:48,086  X1:239 X2:483 Y1:334 Y2:409
No. My stomach felt
queasy all morning.

1217
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,168  X1:213 X2:509 Y1:374 Y2:410
How about a ginger ale?

1218
01:10:50,241 --> 01:10:52,827  X1:206 X2:515 Y1:334 Y2:409
No.
Maybe l'd better lie down.

1219
01:10:52,897 --> 01:10:56,510  X1:182 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
Try to get some of this down.
lt's just plain chicken.

1220
01:10:58,115 --> 01:11:00,963  X1:248 X2:473 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, l can't eat this.
l'm nauseous.

1221
01:11:03,141 --> 01:11:06,720  X1:130 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf you could get me something
to get me through the next two hours.

1222
01:11:06,790 --> 01:11:10,500  X1:140 X2:582 Y1:334 Y2:409
l have to go to Burbank
and give out an award on a TV show.

1223
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:13,120  X1:170 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
There's nothing wrong with you
as far as l can tell.

1224
01:11:13,191 --> 01:11:16,258  X1:155 X2:566 Y1:334 Y2:409
You have no fever,
no symptoms of anything serious.

1225
01:11:16,328 --> 01:11:20,323  X1:137 X2:584 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You haven't eaten pork or shellfish.
- Excuse me. l'm sorry, Doctor.

1226
01:11:20,393 --> 01:11:24,223  X1:141 X2:581 Y1:334 Y2:409
Alvy, that was the show. Everything
is fine. They found a replacement.

1227
01:11:24,298 --> 01:11:26,371  X1:153 X2:569 Y1:374 Y2:410
They're going to tape without you.

1228
01:11:26,443 --> 01:11:28,932  X1:149 X2:572 Y1:334 Y2:409
Jesus!
Now l don't get to do the TV show?

1229
01:11:30,507 --> 01:11:33,192  X1:167 X2:555 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l can't find any reason for this.
- Nothing at all?

1230
01:11:33,261 --> 01:11:37,124  X1:179 X2:542 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l could get a lab man up here.
- Hand me the salt, please.

1231
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:41,093  X1:181 X2:541 Y1:334 Y2:409
Perhaps it would be better
if we took him to the hospital.

1232
01:11:41,167 --> 01:11:42,541  X1:277 X2:445 Y1:374 Y2:410
The hospital?

1233
01:11:42,607 --> 01:11:45,781  X1:123 X2:598 Y1:334 Y2:409
- There's no other way to diagnose him.
- This is not bad, actually.

1234
01:11:50,775 --> 01:11:53,972  X1:148 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
Don't tell me we're going to have
to walk from the car to the house?

1235
01:11:54,039 --> 01:11:56,942  X1:147 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
My feet haven't touched pavement
since l reached Los Angeles.

1236
01:11:57,016 --> 01:12:00,661  X1:145 X2:576 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'll take a meeting with you
if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.

1237
01:12:00,729 --> 01:12:02,869  X1:145 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
l took a meeting with Freddy.
Freddy took a meeting with Charlie.

1238
01:12:02,938 --> 01:12:05,524  X1:155 X2:566 Y1:334 Y2:409
- You take a meeting with him.
- All the good meetings are taken.

1239
01:12:05,594 --> 01:12:07,449  X1:197 X2:525 Y1:374 Y2:410
Right now it's only a notion.

1240
01:12:07,514 --> 01:12:11,444  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
l think l can get money to make it into
a concept, then turn it into an idea.

1241
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:14,135  X1:232 X2:490 Y1:374 Y2:410
Like this house, Max?

1242
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:16,661  X1:201 X2:521 Y1:334 Y2:409
Even wrote a road map
to get us to the bathroom.

1243
01:12:16,733 --> 01:12:18,708  X1:201 X2:521 Y1:334 Y2:409
You should have told me
it was Tony Lacey's party.

1244
01:12:18,781 --> 01:12:20,407  X1:151 X2:570 Y1:374 Y2:410
What difference does that make?

1245
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:22,334  X1:176 X2:546 Y1:374 Y2:410
l think he has a thing for Annie.

1246
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:26,197  X1:130 X2:592 Y1:334 Y2:409
- No. He goes with that girl over there.
- Where?

1247
01:12:26,272 --> 01:12:29,174  X1:222 X2:499 Y1:334 Y2:409
- The one with the VPL.
- VPL?

1248
01:12:29,249 --> 01:12:32,151  X1:255 X2:467 Y1:334 Y2:409
Visible panty line.
She's gorgeous.

1249
01:12:32,225 --> 01:12:35,292  X1:119 X2:602 Y1:334 Y2:409
She's a ten. That's great for you,
'cause you're used to two's, aren't you?

1250
01:12:35,362 --> 01:12:36,889  X1:243 X2:479 Y1:374 Y2:410
There are no two's.

1251
01:12:36,963 --> 01:12:39,484  X1:135 X2:587 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're used to the kind with shopping
bags walking through Central Park...

1252
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:42,108  X1:195 X2:526 Y1:334 Y2:409
with the surgical masks on,
muttering.

1253
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:44,897  X1:124 X2:597 Y1:334 Y2:409
How do you like this couple? They look
like they're from Masters and Johnson.

1254
01:12:44,964 --> 01:12:48,795  X1:235 X2:486 Y1:334 Y2:409
lntensive care ward.
My God!

1255
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:52,700  X1:126 X2:595 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l think she's giving me the eye.
- lf she comes over, my brain will mush.

1256
01:12:53,992 --> 01:12:56,545  X1:203 X2:518 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're Alvy Singer, right?
Didn't we meet at EST?

1257
01:12:56,616 --> 01:12:58,405  X1:223 X2:499 Y1:374 Y2:410
No, l was never to EST.

1258
01:12:58,473 --> 01:13:01,440  X1:173 X2:548 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Then how can you criticize it?
- He didn't say anything.

1259
01:13:01,513 --> 01:13:05,573  X1:152 X2:570 Y1:334 Y2:409
l came to get some shock therapy,
but there was an energy crisis.

1260
01:13:05,643 --> 01:13:08,326  X1:108 X2:614 Y1:334 Y2:409
- He's my food taster. Have you two met?
- How do you do?

1261
01:13:08,395 --> 01:13:11,364  X1:154 X2:568 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Do you taste for poisoned food?
- Yeah, he's great.

1262
01:13:11,437 --> 01:13:13,739  X1:188 X2:534 Y1:334 Y2:409
You guys are wearing white.
lt must be in the stars.

1263
01:13:13,805 --> 01:13:17,548  X1:142 X2:579 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Uri Geller must be on the premises.
- We're going to operate together.

1264
01:13:17,613 --> 01:13:22,404  X1:181 X2:541 Y1:334 Y2:409
ln about six weeks
we could cut the whole album.

1265
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:24,781  X1:230 X2:491 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't know.
This is strange to me.

1266
01:13:24,848 --> 01:13:27,750  X1:165 X2:557 Y1:334 Y2:409
You can stay here.
Use the whole wing in this house.

1267
01:13:27,824 --> 01:13:32,266  X1:182 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Stay here?
- Really. Why are you smiling?

1268
01:13:32,337 --> 01:13:35,688  X1:167 X2:554 Y1:334 Y2:409
Not only is he a great agent,
but he really gives good leading.

1269
01:13:35,762 --> 01:13:40,041  X1:180 X2:542 Y1:334 Y2:409
This is a great house: saunas,
Jacuzzis, three tennis courts.

1270
01:13:40,116 --> 01:13:44,208  X1:111 X2:611 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know who the original owners were?
Nelson Eddy then Legs Diamond.

1271
01:13:44,277 --> 01:13:47,475  X1:165 X2:556 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Then you know who lived here?
- Trigger.

1272
01:13:47,542 --> 01:13:50,804  X1:147 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
Charlie Chaplin,
right before his un-American thing.

1273
01:13:52,247 --> 01:13:56,274  X1:141 X2:580 Y1:334 Y2:409
- But you guys are still New Yorkers.
- Yeah, l love it there.

1274
01:13:56,344 --> 01:14:01,167  X1:185 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
l used to live there for years,
but it's so dirty now.

1275
01:14:01,242 --> 01:14:05,333  X1:172 X2:550 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l'm into garbage. lt's my thing.
- This is a nice screening room.

1276
01:14:05,403 --> 01:14:07,508  X1:125 X2:596 Y1:374 Y2:410
There's another thing about New York.

1277
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:09,652  X1:198 X2:524 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf you want to see a movie,
you have to stand on line.

1278
01:14:09,724 --> 01:14:11,993  X1:179 X2:542 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt could be freezing or raining.
And here--

1279
01:14:12,061 --> 01:14:14,450  X1:135 X2:587 Y1:374 Y2:410
We saw Grand lllusion here last night.

1280
01:14:14,524 --> 01:14:17,373  X1:162 X2:559 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's a great film if you're high.
lt's really funny.

1281
01:14:17,438 --> 01:14:20,570  X1:157 X2:564 Y1:334 Y2:409
Come and see our bedroom.
We did a fantastic thing up there.

1282
01:14:20,638 --> 01:14:22,646  X1:312 X2:409 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm cool.

1283
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:25,567  X1:149 X2:572 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's wonderful.
They eat and watch movies all day.

1284
01:14:25,631 --> 01:14:29,943  X1:111 X2:610 Y1:334 Y2:409
And gradually you get old and die. lt's
important to make an effort sometimes.

1285
01:14:30,017 --> 01:14:32,254  X1:138 X2:584 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Do you think his girlfriend's pretty?
- She's great looking.

1286
01:14:32,322 --> 01:14:35,551  X1:166 X2:555 Y1:374 Y2:410
A little on the androgynous side.

1287
01:14:35,619 --> 01:14:37,474  X1:240 X2:481 Y1:374 Y2:410
l forgot my mantra.

1288
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,571  X1:273 X2:448 Y1:374 Y2:410
That was fun.

1289
01:14:57,641 --> 01:15:00,641  X1:224 X2:498 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't think California
is bad at all.

1290
01:15:00,713 --> 01:15:02,918  X1:211 X2:510 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's a drag coming home.

1291
01:15:02,986 --> 01:15:06,915  X1:203 X2:518 Y1:334 Y2:409
A lot of beautiful women.
lt was fun to flirt.

1292
01:15:06,987 --> 01:15:09,027  X1:233 X2:488 Y1:374 Y2:410
l have to face facts.

1293
01:15:09,099 --> 01:15:13,541  X1:160 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
l adore Alvy, but our relationship
doesn't seem to work anymore.

1294
01:15:13,613 --> 01:15:17,192  X1:206 X2:516 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'll have the usual trouble
with Annie in bed tonight.

1295
01:15:17,262 --> 01:15:19,117  X1:242 X2:479 Y1:374 Y2:410
Why do l need this?

1296
01:15:19,183 --> 01:15:23,919  X1:153 X2:568 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf only l had the nerve to break up,
but it would really hurt him.

1297
01:15:23,984 --> 01:15:27,367  X1:202 X2:519 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf only l didn't feel guilty
asking Annie to move out.

1298
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,670  X1:213 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt'd probably wreck her,
but l should be honest.

1299
01:15:30,737 --> 01:15:33,356  X1:253 X2:468 Y1:374 Y2:410
Alvy, let's face it.

1300
01:15:33,426 --> 01:15:37,005  X1:192 X2:529 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't think our relationship
is working.

1301
01:15:37,076 --> 01:15:39,978  X1:231 X2:491 Y1:334 Y2:409
l know. A relationship
is like a shark:

1302
01:15:40,052 --> 01:15:43,217  X1:213 X2:509 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt has to constantly
move forward or it dies.

1303
01:15:43,285 --> 01:15:47,083  X1:187 X2:535 Y1:334 Y2:409
And l think what we've got
on our hands is a dead shark.

1304
01:15:47,158 --> 01:15:49,809  X1:150 X2:572 Y1:334 Y2:409
- Whose Catcher in the Rye is this?
- lf it has my name on it...

1305
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:51,952  X1:262 X2:459 Y1:374 Y2:410
l guess it's mine.

1306
01:15:52,023 --> 01:15:57,557  X1:134 X2:588 Y1:334 Y2:409
You wrote your name in all my books,
'cause you knew this day would come.

1307
01:15:57,625 --> 01:16:00,942  X1:215 X2:507 Y1:334 Y2:409
You wanted to break up
just as much as l do.

1308
01:16:01,018 --> 01:16:04,793  X1:182 X2:540 Y1:334 Y2:409
No question. l think
we're doing the mature thing.

1309
01:16:04,859 --> 01:16:08,056  X1:183 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
Look. All the books
on death and dying are yours.

1310
01:16:08,124 --> 01:16:10,459  X1:154 X2:567 Y1:374 Y2:410
And all the poetry books are mine.

1311
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:13,787  X1:179 X2:542 Y1:334 Y2:409
Denial of Death.
This is the first book l got you.

1312
01:16:13,853 --> 01:16:15,708  X1:230 X2:491 Y1:374 Y2:410
Remember that day?

1313
01:16:15,773 --> 01:16:18,262  X1:189 X2:532 Y1:334 Y2:409
l feel like there's
a great weight off my back.

1314
01:16:19,902 --> 01:16:21,790  X1:271 X2:451 Y1:374 Y2:410
Thanks, honey.

1315
01:16:21,855 --> 01:16:27,007  X1:144 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
l mean, no. l think it's important
for us to explore new relationships.

1316
01:16:27,073 --> 01:16:31,962  X1:116 X2:606 Y1:334 Y2:409
There's no question about that, because
we've given this a more than fair shot.

1317
01:16:32,034 --> 01:16:34,139  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:334 Y2:409
My analyst thinks this move
is key for me.

1318
01:16:34,210 --> 01:16:38,401  X1:124 X2:598 Y1:334 Y2:409
And l trust her,
because my analyst recommended her.

1319
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:41,436  X1:138 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
Why should l put you through
all my moods and hang-ups anyway?

1320
01:16:41,509 --> 01:16:44,892  X1:104 X2:617 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know what the beauty part is?
We can always come back together again.

1321
01:16:44,966 --> 01:16:47,039  X1:233 X2:489 Y1:334 Y2:409
- There's no problem.
- Exactly.

1322
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:51,551  X1:129 X2:593 Y1:334 Y2:409
l don't think many couples could handle
this, break up and remain friends.

1323
01:16:51,624 --> 01:16:54,209  X1:245 X2:477 Y1:334 Y2:409
This button is mine.
Remember?

1324
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:57,859  X1:118 X2:603 Y1:334 Y2:409
These are yours. "lmpeach Eisenhower."
"lmpeach Nixon."

1325
01:16:57,929 --> 01:17:01,411  X1:197 X2:524 Y1:334 Y2:409
"lmpeach Lyndon Johnson."
"lmpeach Ronald Reagan."

1326
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:06,176  X1:206 X2:516 Y1:334 Y2:409
l miss Annie.
l made a terrible mistake.

1327
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:09,154  X1:204 X2:517 Y1:334 Y2:409
She's living in Los Angeles
with Tony Lacey.

1328
01:17:09,228 --> 01:17:12,644  X1:146 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf she is, then the hell with her. lf
she likes that lifestyle, let her stay.

1329
01:17:12,716 --> 01:17:15,467  X1:204 X2:518 Y1:334 Y2:409
- He's a jerk for one thing.
- He graduated Harvard.

1330
01:17:15,534 --> 01:17:19,277  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:334 Y2:409
Harvard makes mistakes, too.
Kissinger taught there.

1331
01:17:20,207 --> 01:17:22,509  X1:188 X2:533 Y1:374 Y2:410
Don't tell me you're jealous?

1332
01:17:22,576 --> 01:17:24,616  X1:202 X2:520 Y1:334 Y2:409
Yeah. Jealous? A little bit.
Like Medea.

1333
01:17:24,688 --> 01:17:28,203  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
Can l show you something?
l found this in the apartment.

1334
01:17:28,274 --> 01:17:32,879  X1:128 X2:594 Y1:334 Y2:409
Black soap. She used to wash her face
800 times a day with black soap.

1335
01:17:32,947 --> 01:17:34,856  X1:252 X2:470 Y1:374 Y2:410
Don't ask me why.

1336
01:17:34,931 --> 01:17:37,354  X1:114 X2:607 Y1:374 Y2:410
Why don't you go out with other women?

1337
01:17:37,428 --> 01:17:40,561  X1:213 X2:508 Y1:334 Y2:409
l tried,
but it's very depressing.

1338
01:17:40,628 --> 01:17:43,444  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:334 Y2:409
This always happens to me.
Quick! Get a broom!

1339
01:17:43,509 --> 01:17:46,543  X1:225 X2:497 Y1:334 Y2:409
What are you making
such a big deal about?

1340
01:17:46,615 --> 01:17:49,201  X1:230 X2:492 Y1:374 Y2:410
They're only lobsters.

1341
01:17:49,271 --> 01:17:52,436  X1:125 X2:597 Y1:334 Y2:409
-You're adult. You can pick up lobsters.
-l'm not myself since l quit smoking.

1342
01:17:52,503 --> 01:17:55,636  X1:239 X2:483 Y1:334 Y2:409
- When did you quit?
- Sixteen years ago.

1343
01:17:55,705 --> 01:17:58,422  X1:233 X2:489 Y1:334 Y2:409
- What do you mean?
- Mean?

1344
01:18:01,51 --> 01:18:02,362  X1:145 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
You stopped smoking 16 years ago.
ls that what you said?

1345
01:18:04,155 --> 01:18:06,392  X1:247 X2:474 Y1:374 Y2:410
l don't understand.

1346
01:18:06,459 --> 01:18:08,981  X1:213 X2:508 Y1:374 Y2:410
Are you joking or what?

1347
01:18:19,807 --> 01:18:21,913  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:374 Y2:410
Central Park's turning green.

1348
01:18:21,984 --> 01:18:26,655  X1:162 X2:559 Y1:334 Y2:409
l saw that lunatic we used to see
with the pinwheel hat...

1349
01:18:26,721 --> 01:18:29,023  X1:228 X2:494 Y1:374 Y2:410
and the roller-skates.

1350
01:18:29,089 --> 01:18:32,407  X1:138 X2:584 Y1:374 Y2:410
Listen, l want you to come back here.

1351
01:18:32,482 --> 01:18:35,745  X1:134 X2:587 Y1:334 Y2:409
Well, then l'm going to come out there
and get you.

1352
01:18:39,941 --> 01:18:42,146  X1:169 X2:553 Y1:334 Y2:409
What do you mean, where am l?
Where do you think l am?

1353
01:18:42,213 --> 01:18:46,241  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'm at the Los Angeles airport.
l flew in.

1354
01:18:46,311 --> 01:18:49,028  X1:246 X2:476 Y1:374 Y2:410
l flew in to see you.

1355
01:18:49,095 --> 01:18:52,194  X1:219 X2:502 Y1:334 Y2:409
Can we not debate this
on the telephone...

1356
01:18:52,264 --> 01:18:54,982  X1:158 X2:563 Y1:374 Y2:410
because l've got a temperature...

1357
01:18:55,049 --> 01:18:58,955  X1:199 X2:522 Y1:334 Y2:409
and l'm getting my chronic
Los Angeles nausea again.

1358
01:18:59,084 --> 01:19:01,418  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
Wherever you want to meet.
l don't care.

1359
01:19:01,484 --> 01:19:03,372  X1:273 X2:448 Y1:334 Y2:409
l'll drive in.
l rented a car.

1360
01:19:04,493 --> 01:19:06,349  X1:293 X2:429 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm driving.

1361
01:19:06,414 --> 01:19:09,229  X1:181 X2:540 Y1:334 Y2:409
What, is that such a miracle?
l'm driving myself.

1362
01:19:24,851 --> 01:19:27,601  X1:129 X2:593 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm going to have the alfalfa sprouts...

1363
01:19:27,667 --> 01:19:31,181  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:374 Y2:410
and a plate of mashed yeast.

1364
01:19:49,945 --> 01:19:51,538  X1:263 X2:459 Y1:374 Y2:410
You look pretty.

1365
01:19:51,609 --> 01:19:55,091  X1:191 X2:531 Y1:334 Y2:409
No, l just lost a little weight,
that's all.

1366
01:19:59,324 --> 01:20:02,074  X1:249 X2:472 Y1:374 Y2:410
Well, you look nice.

1367
01:20:02,141 --> 01:20:05,818  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:374 Y2:410
l think we should get married.

1368
01:20:05,886 --> 01:20:07,293  X1:304 X2:417 Y1:374 Y2:410
Come on.

1369
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:13,333  X1:170 X2:551 Y1:334 Y2:409
Why, you want to live out here?
lt's like living in Munchkinland.

1370
01:20:13,408 --> 01:20:17,020  X1:196 X2:526 Y1:334 Y2:409
What do you mean?
lt's perfectly fine out here.

1371
01:20:17,088 --> 01:20:20,351  X1:260 X2:462 Y1:374 Y2:410
Tony's very nice.

1372
01:20:20,417 --> 01:20:23,484  X1:193 X2:529 Y1:334 Y2:409
l meet people, go to parties
and play tennis.

1373
01:20:23,554 --> 01:20:26,206  X1:181 X2:541 Y1:374 Y2:410
That's a very big step for me.

1374
01:20:26,275 --> 01:20:29,276  X1:180 X2:541 Y1:374 Y2:410
l'm able to enjoy people more.

1375
01:20:29,348 --> 01:20:32,219  X1:177 X2:544 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're not going to come back
to New York?

1376
01:20:32,293 --> 01:20:36,037  X1:121 X2:601 Y1:334 Y2:409
What's so great about New York? lt's a
dying city. You read Death in Venice.

1377
01:20:36,102 --> 01:20:39,299  X1:172 X2:549 Y1:334 Y2:409
You didn't read Death in Venice
until l bought it for you.

1378
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:42,630  X1:139 X2:583 Y1:334 Y2:409
That's right. You only gave me books
with the word "death" in the title.

1379
01:20:42,696 --> 01:20:44,966  X1:167 X2:555 Y1:374 Y2:410
Because it's an important issue.

1380
01:20:45,032 --> 01:20:47,902  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're incapable of enjoying life.
You know that?

1381
01:20:47,977 --> 01:20:50,312  X1:204 X2:518 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're like New York City.
You're just this person.

1382
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:52,866  X1:146 X2:576 Y1:374 Y2:410
You're like this island unto yourself.

1383
01:20:52,938 --> 01:20:55,906  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:334 Y2:409
l can't enjoy anything
unless everybody is.

1384
01:20:55,979 --> 01:21:00,170  X1:161 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf one guy is starving someplace,
it puts a crimp in my evening.

1385
01:21:02,509 --> 01:21:04,364  X1:185 X2:536 Y1:374 Y2:410
Do you want to get married?

1386
01:21:06,382 --> 01:21:09,416  X1:251 X2:470 Y1:374 Y2:410
No. We're friends.

1387
01:21:09,487 --> 01:21:12,074  X1:211 X2:511 Y1:374 Y2:410
l want to remain friends.

1388
01:21:14,064 --> 01:21:15,438  X1:275 X2:446 Y1:374 Y2:410
Check please.

1389
01:21:15,505 --> 01:21:18,375  X1:215 X2:507 Y1:374 Y2:410
You're mad, aren't you?

1390
01:21:18,449 --> 01:21:21,200  X1:159 X2:562 Y1:334 Y2:409
Yes, of course l'm mad,
because you love me. l know that.

1391
01:21:21,267 --> 01:21:23,688  X1:201 X2:521 Y1:334 Y2:409
l can't say that that's true
at this point in my life.

1392
01:21:23,763 --> 01:21:26,381  X1:190 X2:531 Y1:374 Y2:410
l really can't say that's true.

1393
01:21:26,451 --> 01:21:29,234  X1:156 X2:565 Y1:374 Y2:410
You know how wonderful you are.

1394
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:33,011  X1:123 X2:598 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're the reason l got out of my room,
that l was able to sing...

1395
01:21:33,078 --> 01:21:37,235  X1:127 X2:595 Y1:334 Y2:409
and get more in touch with my feelings
and all that crap.

1396
01:21:37,302 --> 01:21:39,604  X1:280 X2:442 Y1:374 Y2:410
Listen, listen.

1397
01:21:40,824 --> 01:21:42,482  X1:220 X2:502 Y1:374 Y2:410
So what are you up to?

1398
01:21:44,792 --> 01:21:48,568  X1:186 X2:536 Y1:334 Y2:409
The usual. l'm trying to write.
l'm working on a play.

1399
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:52,818  X1:128 X2:593 Y1:334 Y2:409
Are you saying you're not coming back
to New York with me?

1400
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:58,647  X1:298 X2:424 Y1:334 Y2:409
No. Look.
l gotta go.

1401
01:21:58,717 --> 01:22:01,946  X1:184 X2:537 Y1:334 Y2:409
What do you mean?
l flew 3,000 miles to see you.

1402
01:22:02,013 --> 01:22:04,664  X1:165 X2:556 Y1:334 Y2:409
Air miles. Do you know
what that does to my stomach?

1403
01:22:04,733 --> 01:22:06,643  X1:202 X2:519 Y1:334 Y2:409
lf you must know,
it's a hectic time for Tony.

1404
01:22:06,718 --> 01:22:08,628  X1:193 X2:528 Y1:334 Y2:409
- The Grammys are tonight.
- The what?

1405
01:22:08,703 --> 01:22:10,744  X1:191 X2:531 Y1:334 Y2:409
The Grammys. He's got a lot
of records up for awards.

1406
01:22:10,815 --> 01:22:13,402  X1:153 X2:568 Y1:334 Y2:409
They give awards for that music?
l thought just ear plugs.

1407
01:22:13,473 --> 01:22:16,889  X1:208 X2:513 Y1:334 Y2:409
Just forget it. Let's just
forget the conversation.

1408
01:22:16,961 --> 01:22:19,930  X1:137 X2:584 Y1:334 Y2:409
They do nothing but give out awards.
l can't believe it.

1409
01:22:20,001 --> 01:22:23,068  X1:197 X2:524 Y1:334 Y2:409
Greatest Fascist Dictator:
Adolph Hitler.

1410
01:22:52,075 --> 01:22:54,825  X1:167 X2:554 Y1:334 Y2:409
l know what you're going to say.
l'm not a great driver.

1411
01:22:54,892 --> 01:22:57,925  X1:167 X2:555 Y1:334 Y2:409
- l have some problems with--
- May l see your license, please?

1412
01:22:57,997 --> 01:23:00,485  X1:234 X2:488 Y1:374 Y2:410
Just don't get angry.

1413
01:23:00,557 --> 01:23:04,268  X1:226 X2:496 Y1:334 Y2:409
l have my license here.
lt's a rented car.

1414
01:23:06,158 --> 01:23:09,355  X1:176 X2:545 Y1:374 Y2:410
Don't give me your life's story.

1415
01:23:09,423 --> 01:23:11,594  X1:217 X2:504 Y1:374 Y2:410
Just pick up the license.

1416
01:23:11,664 --> 01:23:15,374  X1:146 X2:575 Y1:334 Y2:409
You have to ask nicely, because
l've had a rough day. My girlfriend--

1417
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,808  X1:166 X2:556 Y1:374 Y2:410
Just give me the license, please.

1418
01:23:19,506 --> 01:23:22,190  X1:202 X2:519 Y1:334 Y2:409
Since you put it that way,
it's hard for me to refuse.

1419
01:23:22,259 --> 01:23:25,227  X1:213 X2:509 Y1:334 Y2:409
l have a terrific problem
with authority.

1420
01:23:25,299 --> 01:23:27,602  X1:226 X2:496 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's not your fault.
Don't take it personal.

1421
01:23:35,478 --> 01:23:37,934  X1:261 X2:460 Y1:334 Y2:409
So long, fellows.
Keep in touch.

1422
01:23:47,065 --> 01:23:50,744  X1:238 X2:484 Y1:334 Y2:409
lmagine my surprise
when l got your call.

1423
01:23:50,811 --> 01:23:53,911  X1:201 X2:521 Y1:334 Y2:409
Yeah. l had the feeling
l got you at a bad moment.

1424
01:23:53,979 --> 01:23:56,184  X1:175 X2:546 Y1:374 Y2:410
l heard high-pitched squealing.

1425
01:23:56,252 --> 01:23:57,659  X1:290 X2:432 Y1:374 Y2:410
Twins, Max.

1426
01:23:58,525 --> 01:24:00,500  X1:246 X2:475 Y1:374 Y2:410
Sixteen-year-olds.

1427
01:24:01,949 --> 01:24:05,528  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:334 Y2:409
Can you imagine the mathematical
possibilities of that?

1428
01:24:05,599 --> 01:24:08,948  X1:142 X2:580 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're an actor. You should be doing
Shakespeare in the park.

1429
01:24:09,023 --> 01:24:12,221  X1:182 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
l did Shakespeare in the park.
l got mugged.

1430
01:24:12,289 --> 01:24:15,551  X1:130 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
l was playing Richard ll. Two guys
with leather jackets stole my leotard.

1431
01:24:20,898 --> 01:24:24,063  X1:149 X2:572 Y1:374 Y2:410
Are we driving through plutonium?

1432
01:24:24,131 --> 01:24:27,448  X1:204 X2:517 Y1:334 Y2:409
Keeps out the alpha rays.
You don't get old.

1433
01:24:29,636 --> 01:24:32,834  X1:151 X2:570 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're a thinking person.
How can you choose this lifestyle?

1434
01:24:32,902 --> 01:24:35,521  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:374 Y2:410
What is so great about New York?

1435
01:24:35,591 --> 01:24:38,658  X1:206 X2:516 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt's a dying city.
You read Death in Venice.

1436
01:24:38,727 --> 01:24:41,029  X1:172 X2:549 Y1:334 Y2:409
You didn't read Death in Venice
until l gave it to you.

1437
01:24:41,097 --> 01:24:43,333  X1:160 X2:561 Y1:334 Y2:409
You only give me books
with the word "death" in the title.

1438
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:47,144  X1:153 X2:569 Y1:334 Y2:409
- lt's an important issue.
- You're incapable of enjoying life.

1439
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:50,178  X1:232 X2:490 Y1:334 Y2:409
You're like New York.
You're an island.

1440
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:53,731  X1:156 X2:565 Y1:334 Y2:409
Okay. lf that's all that we've been
through together means to you...

1441
01:24:53,803 --> 01:24:57,317  X1:145 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
it's better if we just said good-bye,
once and for all.

1442
01:24:57,388 --> 01:24:58,850  X1:300 X2:421 Y1:374 Y2:410
lt's funny.

1443
01:24:58,925 --> 01:25:01,227  X1:197 X2:524 Y1:334 Y2:409
After all the serious talks
and passionate moments...

1444
01:25:01,293 --> 01:25:04,677  X1:160 X2:562 Y1:334 Y2:409
that it ends here, in a health food
restaurant on Sunset Boulevard.

1445
01:25:05,422 --> 01:25:07,725  X1:262 X2:459 Y1:374 Y2:410
Good-bye, Sally.

1446
01:25:07,791 --> 01:25:12,047  X1:216 X2:505 Y1:334 Y2:409
Wait.
l'm going to go with you.

1447
01:25:12,113 --> 01:25:14,000  X1:302 X2:420 Y1:374 Y2:410
l love you.

1448
01:25:17,266 --> 01:25:20,049  X1:239 X2:483 Y1:334 Y2:409
What do you want?
lt was my first play.

1449
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:23,050  X1:128 X2:594 Y1:334 Y2:409
You know how you're always trying to
get things to come out perfect in art...

1450
01:25:23,124 --> 01:25:26,223  X1:168 X2:553 Y1:374 Y2:410
because it's real difficult in life.

1451
01:25:26,292 --> 01:25:30,668  X1:211 X2:510 Y1:334 Y2:409
lnterestingly, however,
l did run into Annie again.

1452
01:25:30,741 --> 01:25:32,716  X1:179 X2:543 Y1:334 Y2:409
lt was on the Upper West Side
of Manhattan.

1453
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:36,369  X1:135 X2:587 Y1:334 Y2:409
She had moved back to New York.
She was living in Soho with some guy.

1454
01:25:36,439 --> 01:25:40,368  X1:131 X2:591 Y1:334 Y2:409
When l met her, she was dragging him
in to see The Sorrow and the Pity...

1455
01:25:40,439 --> 01:25:42,928  X1:222 X2:500 Y1:334 Y2:409
which l counted
as a personal triumph.

1456
01:25:43,001 --> 01:25:45,652  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:334 Y2:409
Annie and l had lunch
sometime after that...

1457
01:25:45,721 --> 01:25:49,585  X1:160 X2:562 Y1:374 Y2:410
and just kicked around old times.

1458
01:25:49,658 --> 01:25:53,621  X1:229 X2:492 Y1:374 Y2:410
Just to have my arms

1459
01:25:55,612 --> 01:25:57,554  X1:291 X2:431 Y1:374 Y2:410
Around you

1460
01:26:01,054 --> 01:26:04,438  X1:283 X2:438 Y1:374 Y2:410
Still the thrill

1461
01:26:05,022 --> 01:26:08,155  X1:243 X2:479 Y1:374 Y2:410
That it was the day

1462
01:26:08,224 --> 01:26:10,429  X1:294 X2:427 Y1:374 Y2:410
l found you

1463
01:26:11,296 --> 01:26:14,429  X1:296 X2:426 Y1:374 Y2:410
Seems like

1464
01:26:16,577 --> 01:26:21,150  X1:303 X2:419 Y1:374 Y2:410
Old times

1465
01:26:23,651 --> 01:26:28,835  X1:206 X2:516 Y1:374 Y2:410
Dinner dates and flowers

1466
01:26:31,558 --> 01:26:33,500  X1:303 X2:419 Y1:374 Y2:410
Old times

1467
01:26:34,886 --> 01:26:37,637  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:334 Y2:409
After that, it got late
and we both had to go.

1468
01:26:37,703 --> 01:26:39,809  X1:139 X2:582 Y1:374 Y2:410
But it was great seeing Annie again.

1469
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:42,499  X1:160 X2:562 Y1:334 Y2:409
l realize
what a terrific person she was...

1470
01:26:42,569 --> 01:26:45,319  X1:209 X2:513 Y1:334 Y2:409
and how much fun it was
just knowing her.

1471
01:26:45,385 --> 01:26:48,899  X1:177 X2:545 Y1:374 Y2:410
And l thought of that old joke.

1472
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:53,608  X1:144 X2:577 Y1:334 Y2:409
This guy goes to a psychiatrist
and says, "Doc, my brother's crazy.

1473
01:26:53,676 --> 01:26:56,164  X1:209 X2:513 Y1:374 Y2:410
He thinks he's a chicken."

1474
01:26:56,237 --> 01:26:58,441  X1:191 X2:531 Y1:334 Y2:409
The doctor says,
"Why don't you turn him in?"

1475
01:26:58,509 --> 01:27:01,445  X1:183 X2:539 Y1:334 Y2:409
The guy says,
"l would, but l need the eggs."

1476
01:27:01,518 --> 01:27:05,894  X1:148 X2:573 Y1:334 Y2:409
Well, l guess that's, now, how l feel
about relationships.

1477
01:27:05,967 --> 01:27:10,791  X1:205 X2:517 Y1:334 Y2:409
They're totally irrational,
crazy and absurd.

1478
01:27:10,864 --> 01:27:13,734  X1:131 X2:591 Y1:374 Y2:410
But l guess we keep going through it...

1479
01:27:13,809 --> 01:27:16,876  X1:147 X2:574 Y1:374 Y2:410
because most of us need the eggs.
