the woman I fell in love with.

147
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:29,192
她就像我生命中的一道闪耀的光芒
She was like a flash of bright light.

148
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:33,229
一个能吸引众多目光有着匀称的臀部线条的公主
A callipygian princess who drew people to her like a magnet.

149
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,633
如果你们不知道匀称的臀部线条是什么意思的话
And for those of you who don't know what callipygian means,

150
00:10:36,634 --> 00:10:38,435
那我就告诉你们 意思是她的臀部非常漂亮
it means she has a nice bottom.

151
00:10:38,436 --> 00:10:42,239
-哇    -真的很棒
-Ooh.  -She did.

152
00:10:44,142 --> 00:10:47,143
真希望我有更多的时间陪伴着她
I wish I had more time with her.

153
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:50,916
真希望我们没有在争吵中浪费那么多的美好时光
I wish so much of our time had not been consumed by combat.

154
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:54,821
真希望我之前能努力不让争吵发生
I wish I'd tried a little harder to make that happen.

155
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,195
但现在她已离去
Because she's gone now.

00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:01,495
我们已共同书写了活在这世上的篇章
And our history on this earth has been written...

156
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:04,600
宝贝
Baby.

157
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,668

00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:11,671
-嗨 老弟     -嗨

Sit.

160
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:16,677
这是我的女儿和孙子
This is my daughter and grandson.

161
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,346
我可以和你说几句吗
Can I have a word with you?

162
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:23,681
可以啊 但是丧礼才进行到一半
Yeah, I'm in the middle of something.

163
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,350
Billy 先在那边坐一会
Billy, just stay there for a second.

164
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,518
我要跟你爷爷到外面谈点事
I just want to talk to your granddad outside.

165
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,854
好的 妈咪
Okay, Mom.

166
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:31,095
抱歉 失陪一会
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

167
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,796
嗨 Billy
Hi, Billy.

168
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,396
什么事这么重要
What's so important?

169
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:41,331
关于妈妈去世和所有的事情我感到很抱歉
Listen, I'm sorry that she's dead and everything,

170
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:43,133
但是我真的有很紧急的事要和你说
but I'm in some serious shit, okay?

171
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:45,269
-这次又怎么了             -你得告诉他麦克风没关
-What is it this time?    -You tell him about the microphone.

172
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,537
别一上来就跟我那么说 至少不是现在
Don't even start that with me! Not now!

173
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:49,540
好吗 这不是我的错
Okay? It wasn't even my fault!

174
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,277
那个警察 他给他装了一个窃听器
This cop, he's got a bug up his ass,

175
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,845
然后他们给我找了个公诉辩护律师
and then they give me this public defender

176
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,713
结果那律师是个蠢货  然后...
who's a fucking idiot! And...

177
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,382
先生 打扰一下 麦克风还开着
Sir, excuse me. The microphone is on.

178
00:11:58,383 --> 00:12:00,544
拜托给我一点时间 就一点时间
Please, just give me a moment. Just give me a moment.

179
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:04,421
听着 我违法了我假释时说的话
Look, I violated my parole

180
00:12:04,422 --> 00:12:06,891
现在条子要把我送进监狱
and now they're gonna send me to jail.

181
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,527
我只需要你带着Billy过境
I just need you to take Billy across the country

182
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,428
这样他就可以暂时待在他爸爸身边了 好吗
so he can be with his dad for a while. Okay?

183
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:12,564
什么
What?

184
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,566
我现在不能带着Bobby  我还在服丧啊
I can't have Bobby with me now. I'm in mourning!

185
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:17,500
他叫Billy  Billy
It's Billy. Billy!

186
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:19,504
我怎么知道他叫什么名字
How am I supposed to know what his name is?

187
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,272
你从来没有带他来看过我
You never brought him around!

188
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,034
就算你把他带来了 他会尿在家里的每一张床上
And when you did bring him around, he pissed every bed in the house.

189
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,442
我没有尿床
I don't pee my bed anymore.

190
00:12:25,443 --> 00:12:27,945
我现在不能带着Billy
I cannot have Billy with me now.

191
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:30,015
46年来我第一获得自由
I am a free man for the first time in 46 years

192
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:34,685
我不能让这小子再次毁了我的自由
and I can't be saddled with that cockblock!

193
00:12:34,686 --> 00:12:35,787
那好
That's just fine.

194
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:36,854
我小的时候你从来都不在我身边
You were never there for me when I was little,

195
00:12:36,855 --> 00:12:38,523
所以我猜现在也没差别 对不对
so I guess it's no different now, is it?

196
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,700
我要去和我妈妈说几句
I'm going to talk to my mom.

197
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,668
非常抱歉
I am very sorry. Um...

198
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:54,171
现在我们的情绪都十分激动
Everyone's very emotional right now.

199
00:12:54,172 --> 00:12:55,892
现在对我们家来说是个非常艰难的时期
It's a very difficult time for the family.

200
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,046
呃... 我不知道该说什么
Uh... I don't know what to say.

201
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:05,615
宝贝 过来  那是你妈妈的...
Sweetie, come here. That's your mother's.

202
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:06,850
她告诉我 现在这个东西归我了
She told me I could have it.

203
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:08,518
把它给我...  给我...
Give me the... Give it...

204
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:11,788
不要在大家的面前这样子 不要在这时候做这种事
Don't do this in front of them! Don't do this right now!

205
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:12,856
别闹了
Just stop...

206
00:13:12,857 --> 00:13:15,561
-喔 不    -喔 我的老天爷啊

Where are we going?

226
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,099
我们来这用电脑和你老爹谈点事
We're going here to get on a computer call with your dad

227
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,234
问他什么时候来把你这熊孩子接走

然后我找了个人来帮我们
And I got someone meeting us

和你老爹进行沟通

00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:32,059

是这样的
So, uh, Kimmie

248
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:57,119
Kimmie又挨蹲号子了 知道吗

249
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,723
一点也不意外
Doesn't surprise me.

250
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:02,562
所以 我要你来我这里把Billy接回去
So I need you to come get Billy, like, from me.

251
00:16:04,562 --> 00:16:06,629
你摇什么头
Why are you shaking your head?

252
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,398
因为现在对我来说是困难时期
Cause this is real bad timing right now for me.

253
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:12,302
我的生意上现在有很多问题
I'm having some problems with my business right now.

254
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:13,803
-好     -你的生意?
-Okay.  -Oh, your business, huh?

255
00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:15,571
是什么样的生意
What business is that?

256
00:16:15,572 --> 00:16:17,074
我是卖电脑的
I sell computers.

257
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:19,308
还卖电脑... 他连在载满兵佬的火车上拉皮条都做不到
Sell... He couldn't sell pussy on a troop train.

258
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:20,978
喔 你说的实在是太没下限了
Oh, that's a disgusting thing to say.

259
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:22,479
行了 这样是解决不了问题的
Okay, but that doesn't help. That doesn't help.

260
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,080
没错 你说得对
You're right. You're right.

261
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:25,202
对不起 我辱骂了你
I'm sorry for insulting you.

262
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:29,123
你认真点行吗
Are you serious?

263
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,123
糟透了
This is a disaster.

264
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,625
好了 Chuck
All right, Chuck.

265
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:37,464
如果你不来林肯市
If you can't come to Lincoln,

266
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,297
那我就带着他到北卡罗莱纳州去找你
then I'll just bring him to you in North Carolina.

267
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:44,401
别 我可没钱照顾那孩子
No. 'Cause I don't have money to take care of a kid.

268
00:16:44,402 --> 00:16:46,571
我表第 他刚刚领了一个女儿
My cousin, he just had to take his baby girl,

269
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,306
然后国家每个月会给他600刀的抚养补助
and the state's paying him $600 a month for free.

270
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:51,675
你确定要把他带到他父亲身边吗
Are you sure you want him to go to him?

271
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:53,444
-他拿得到600刀?           -一个月
-He's getting 600 bucks?  -A month.

272
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:54,845
等等 他们在说啥
Wait, what are they saying?

273
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:57,614
她说 他可能因为抚养孩子而得到那些钱
She's saying possibly he could get money for keeping him.

274
00:16:57,615 --> 00:16:59,850
我想我可能有办法了
I think I can work something out.

275
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:02,854
我觉得如果Irving带那孩子
I think that if Irving was to

276
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,956
来罗利市的话 我也许能照顾他
bring him here to Raleigh, I could take the kid.

277
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:08,459
如果不行的话呢
And then if it didn't work out...

278
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,060
只要每个月有600刀 那就没问题了
600 bucks a month will make it work for me.

279
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:13,529
那... 你能保证
So... And that isn't guaranteed,

280
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,964
她说的都是真的吗
what she just said. It's something

281
00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:16,333
-这件事你得去调查一下            -不 不用 保证没问题
-you would have to investigate.  -No, no, it's guaranteed.

282
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:17,701
她说的不会有错的
She's always right.

283
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:19,303
就这么愉快的决定了 老兄 把他带过来吧
It's a done deal, man. Drop him off.

284
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,805
好  那就星期天2点
All right, 2:00 on Sunday.

285
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,806
星期天下午2点
2:00 p.m. Sunday.

286
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,043
给力 兄弟 你真给力
Great, man. Great. Great.

287
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:28,211
那些可是我一半的身家
There goes like half my inventory.

Well, it's not so sad, she was kind of a bitch, but...

335
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,832
天啊
Jeez!

336
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,534
我的老天爷啊
My goodness!

337
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:34,637
我只是实话实说
Well, gotta call a spade a spade.

338
00:19:34,638 --> 00:19:37,875
那边好像有人找麻烦
Well, there goes the troublemaker.

339
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,044
喂 你这是什么态度
Well, what kind of attitude is that?

How much is this?

344
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:53,824
上面不是标有价格了吗
Is there a price tag on it?

345
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,394
我没看见... 有一个...
I don't... There's a...

346
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:58,161

就像是口臭一样 不过是下面的
It's kind of like bad breath, but the vagina.

351
00:20:07,605 --> 00:20:10,106
这不是主要的原因  但...
It wasn't the main cause, but...

352
00:20:10,107 --> 00:20:11,067
-也没起到好的作用   -嗯

然后在该死的殡仪馆出了点小差错
and the damn funeral home had a little misunderstanding.

415
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:05,451
你知道怎么样吗 他们又把她送了回来

我们结婚以后 她就像我菊花里的淡淡哀伤
Yeah. She was a pain in my ass when we were married

00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,479
而现在她走了却还依旧如此

450
00:24:48,118 --> 00:24:50,820

但是没有人愿意过来帮忙

如果你说的是"你能来和我一起干犯罪的事吗"
No one's going to come out to help if you say,

462
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,443
会有人肯帮你那才叫见鬼
"Can you come help me commit a crime?"

463
00:25:13,444 --> 00:25:15,312
因为没人愿意帮忙 所以咯...
No one's gonna help. So...

464
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:21,317
这就是为什么我不得不撒个小谎的原因
We, uh... That's why we had to tell a little fib.

但我或许可以唤醒沉睡的雄狮

他现在可能喝醉了

"你来修"
"You're gonna fix it!"

1340
01:07:49,264 --> 01:07:50,431
"不 是你"
"No, you're gonna!"

Table for two?

比猴子的屁股还红
That was redder than an ape's ass.

1350
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,093
嘴巴放干净点
Watch your mouth.

1351
01:08:19,094 --> 01:08:20,461
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

1352
01:08:20,462 --> 01:08:22,403
比猴子的臀部还红
That was redder than an ape's tuchas.

他习惯来点重口味的
He used to have a big taste for it.

1359
01:08:42,317 --> 01:08:44,655
为什么我妈妈不喜欢我
Why doesn't my mom like me?

1360
01:08:47,655 --> 01:08:49,823
你妈妈喜欢你的 老弟
Your mom likes you, buddy.

1361
01:08:49,824 --> 01:08:52,326
那她为什么要离开我
Then why'd she run away from me?

1362
01:08:52,327 --> 01:08:53,997
呃...
Well...

1363
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:59,666

Mom's got to go away for a little bit, and so...

01:09:18,052 --> 01:09:19,886
把耳朵堵住
Earplugs.

我的天啊
Dear God.

1379
01:09:44,979 --> 01:09:46,813
我觉得
I think

1380
01:09:46,814 --> 01:09:49,520
爷爷要来个响声炮了
all this bacon is getting to Grandpa.

1381
01:10:02,497 --> 01:10:04,466
刚刚是你放的屁吗 爷爷
Did you... Did you just toot, Grandpa?

1382
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,667
那是壁虎的叫声啦
That was a church house creeper.

1383
01:10:07,668 --> 01:10:08,871
我想我也要来一发
I think I got one.

1384
01:10:13,307 --> 01:10:15,676
我觉得你把翔给喷裤子上了
I think you need to clean out your shorts.

1385
01:10:18,046 --> 01:10:19,714
真恶心
Beat that.

1386
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:22,049
我有点闹肚子了
Grandpa's tummy's hurting.

1387
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:23,484
别憋着了
Let it out.

1388
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:28,324
我要来一发大的
Try this one on for size.

1389
01:10:37,265 --> 01:10:38,566
-天啊      -呃 爷爷

1390
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,567

01:11:01,421 --> 01:11:02,760
喔 不
Oh, no.

1399
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,394
那老头子站在椅子上
That guy stood up on the chair part

1400
01:11:08,395 --> 01:11:10,098
然后翔就喷到墙上了
and pooped on the wall.

1401
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,619
-他什么    -他把翔喷在墙上
-He what?  -And he pooped on the wall.

1402
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:22,246
投得好 很好 再来一次
Oh, good shot. Good... Take it again. Take it again.

1403
01:11:25,246 --> 01:11:26,451
太棒了
Oh, Jesus.

1404
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:32,286
你想看看我的本事吗
All right. You want some of this?

1405
01:11:32,287 --> 01:11:35,121
为什么我就不能和你待在一起 而非要去我爸爸那
Why can't I just stay with you instead of my dad?

1406
01:11:35,122 --> 01:11:36,724
因为那是计划外的事
'Cause that's not the plan.

1407
01:11:36,725 --> 01:11:38,931
我们可以改变计划
We can change the plan.

1408
01:11:46,467 --> 01:11:49,803
这样如何 如果我投进了这球
How about this? If I make this shot,

1409
01:11:49,804 --> 01:11:51,405
我就待在你身边 不去我爸那里了
I get to stay with you instead of my dad.

1410
01:11:52,006 --> 01:11:53,641
好啊
All right.

1411
01:11:54,641 --> 01:11:56,912
滚蛋吧
Get that out of here!

1412
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:04,518
我们要怎么样才能去
How about we become tuna fishermen

1413
01:12:04,519 --> 01:12:06,153
日本打金枪鱼
and then move to Japan?

1414
01:12:06,154 --> 01:12:07,021
喔 孩子
Oh, boy.

1415
01:12:09,157 --> 01:12:10,858
我们开个海鲜店
We'll get a fish market

1416
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:14,328
然后把所有的金枪鱼卖了 这样我们就变成亿万富翁了
and then we sell all tuna and we'll be billionaires.

1417
01:12:14,329 --> 01:12:18,264
地球人都知道日本有好多的金枪鱼
There is lots of tuna in Japan, that's for sure!

1418
01:12:18,265 --> 01:12:21,006
这是我有生以来听过的最棒的主意
That's the best idea I heard in years, son.

1419
01:12:25,006 --> 01:12:27,841
你喜欢钓鱼吗 老家伙
Do you like to fish, old man?

1420
01:12:27,842 --> 01:12:31,014
我以前也很喜欢钓鱼 但那是过去的事了
I used to like to fish a lot, but that was before.

1421
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,016
什么过去
Before what?

1422
01:12:36,016 --> 01:12:38,617
那是一段黑历史
Before a dark day when

1423
01:12:38,618 --> 01:12:41,127
当时我抓到了我的大白鲸...
I caught my very own Moby Dick.

1424
01:12:47,127 --> 01:12:48,696
哇
Whoa!

1425
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:50,064

A little help!

1430
01:13:11,418 --> 01:13:12,389
老兄
Oh, man!

1431
01:13:14,389 --> 01:13:16,723
来看看这只超级大屌鱼
Check out the nine iron on this one.

1432
01:13:16,724 --> 01:13:17,858
喔
Oh!

1433
01:13:17,859 --> 01:13:19,059
天啊

1434
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:20,661
喔 卧槽
Oh, shit.

1435
01:13:20,662 --> 01:13:22,130
那是啥 那是啥啊
What is that? What is that?

1436
01:13:23,564 --> 01:13:26,500
这是只超大号的屌鱼
It's a large-nose carpet croaker!

1437
01:13:26,501 --> 01:13:27,301
好吧
Yeah. Okay.

1438
01:13:41,082 --> 01:13:44,720
从那以后 我就再也不吃鱼了
After that, I never ate fish sticks again.

1439
01:13:47,421 --> 01:13:48,222
爷爷 我肚子饿了
Grandpa, I'm hungry.

1440
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:52,698
你知道吗 我突然灵光一闪
You know what? I may have a solution.

1441
01:14:00,868 --> 01:14:02,702
你确定这是个好主意吗
Are you sure this is a good idea?

1442
01:14:02,703 --> 01:14:03,804
当然确定
Of course it is.

1443
01:14:03,805 --> 01:14:05,406
你会要什么有什么
You can get away with most anything,

1444
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:07,441
你只需要
all you got to do is try.

1445
01:14:07,442 --> 01:14:08,284
听我的指挥
Follow my lead.

1446
01:14:17,284 --> 01:14:20,121
好了 各位 可以在这给大家来一张照片吗
Okay, folks, can we get a picture here with everyone?

1447
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:23,390
大家可以往后退一点吗
Can everybody back up on this side a little bit?

1448
01:14:23,391 --> 01:14:25,627
往后退几步就行
Just kinda take a couple steps back.

1449
01:14:26,627 --> 01:14:29,666

这是她的遗愿
This is what she wanted.

你最后还有什么想要和奶奶说的话吗
You got any final words for your grandma?

我要黑色那条
I call black one!

1774
01:34:24,056 --> 01:34:26,826
你想要黑色那条?  好 那我要红色的
You got the black one?  Okay, I got the red one.

爷爷 我想嘘嘘
Grandpa, I got to pee-pee.

1777
01:34:30,730 --> 01:34:32,398
你想嘘嘘?
You got to pee-pee?

1778
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:34,733
好吧 那把你的小伙伴穿过栏杆
Well, dangle that little thing through the railing

1779
01:34:34,734 --> 01:34:36,167
让奶奶安息吧
and let her rip.

1780
01:34:36,168 --> 01:34:39,439
但我想说这样做的话对你奶奶是大不敬唷
But point it that way out of respect for your grandmother.

1781
01:35:04,297 --> 01:35:06,899
老兄 你他妈给我滚远点
Man, get the fuck away from me.

1782
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:08,134
我怎么了
What did I do?

1783
01:35:08,135 --> 01:35:10,068
可以抱抱我吗 老爸
Can I get a hug? Dad?

1784
01:35:10,069 --> 01:35:12,338
这可一点都不好玩 大胖小子
That wouldn't be appropriate, big guy.

1785
01:35:15,309 --> 01:35:17,041
他说你是只肥美的猫咪(pussy)
He says you have a fat kitty cat.

1786
01:35:17,042 --> 01:35:18,176
好吧
Okay.

1787
01:35:18,177 --> 01:35:19,411

摇摇我的...  嗷 摇啊 摇啊
Jiggle my... Ow! Jiggle! Jiggle!

他有胡子
He's got a moustache,

Listen, old man. I ain't fucking young.

I'm 45 years old. I'll fucking tune you up. All right?

刚刚你们在这里看到的那老头是Johnny Knoxville先生
The gentleman you just saw in here was Mr. Johnny Knoxville

1798
01:35:44,938 --> 01:35:47,207
还有就是我们在秘密拍摄一部电影
and we are shooting a movie.

1799
01:35:52,845 --> 01:35:54,013
非常感谢大家
Thank you, everyone,

1800

Doris 你是怎么想的
Doris, what did you think?

1808
01:36:09,863 --> 01:36:12,297
我妈妈应该不会喜欢这个的
My mother's not gonna like this!

1809
01:36:13,533 --> 01:36:14,934
我们其实在拍电影
We're shooting a movie.

And a rusty trombone for my grandpa.

1815
01:36:25,645 --> 01:36:27,545
给你爷爷一个生锈的长号 是吧?
A rusty trombone for your grandpa, huh?

1816
01:36:27,546 --> 01:36:28,648
是的
Yep.

1817
01:36:28,649 --> 01:36:29,881
我要给你拍张照
Well, I need to take your picture

1818
01:36:29,882 --> 01:36:32,718
以确认你是不是某地的失踪儿
to see if you're on a milk carton somewhere.

1819
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:34,821
你觉得呢
What do you think?

01:37:45,958 --> 01:37:48,461
说话再像个老头一点啦
Talk more like an old man.

1836
01:37:48,462 --> 01:37:49,561
-我吗  -是的
-Me?   -Yes.

1837
01:37:52,298 --> 01:37:54,969
这声音听起来太像Johnny Knoxville了
Yeah, he sounds like Johnny Knoxville.

1838
01:37:57,637 --> 01:38:01,608
我恨这工作 我他妈恨死你们了
I hate this job. I fucking hate you!

1839
01:38:02,809 --> 01:38:06,912
那里藏着个摄影机
This is a camera, in there.

1841
01:38:06,913 --> 01:38:08,480
这边也有一个
That's a camera.

1842
01:38:08,481 --> 01:38:10,787
我觉得这角落里也有个摄影机
I think there's a camera here somewhere.

1843
01:38:16,023 --> 01:38:17,122
对着镜头说几句
Talk to that.

1844
01:38:17,123 --> 01:38:18,858
好 嗨 你好吗
Okay, and when... Hi, how are you?

1845
01:38:18,859 --> 01:38:21,997
喔 看看我 我看起来是不是很漂亮
Oh, look at me! I look beautiful!

1846
01:38:23,997 --> 01:38:25,765
刚刚那个是绿茶婊
That's one ugly bitch.

1847
01:38:27,033 --> 01:38:28,700
每次和这些家伙们共事 我都觉得很有意思
It's interesting. Every time I work with these guys,

1848
01:38:28,701 --> 01:38:30,341
不是我整你就是你整我
I'm either in a casket or around a casket.

1849
01:38:43,115 --> 01:38:44,353
我喜欢站这里
I like standing here.

1850
01:38:46,353 --> 01:38:48,353
我还喜欢站这里
And I like standing here.

1851
01:38:48,354 --> 01:38:51,357
但我最喜欢的是这里
But my favorite spot is here.

1852
01:38:51,358 --> 01:38:52,791
-别这么小气  -滚开
-Come on.    -Get away.

1853
01:38:52,792 --> 01:38:55,461
我可能因为太老而硬不起来
I may be too old to stir the gumbo,

1854
01:38:55,462 --> 01:38:57,863
但是我敢肯定我还可以当个"小舔心"
but I can still lick the ladle, that's for sure.

1855
01:38:59,032 --> 01:39:00,398
在我看来
In my opinion, ladle-licking

1856
01:39:00,399 --> 01:39:02,867
能舔比能插更重要
is more important than gumbo-stirring anyway.

1857
01:39:02,868 --> 01:39:05,304
我可以舔我的眉毛
Oh, I can lick my eyebrows.

1858
01:39:05,305 --> 01:39:06,907
滚一边去
Get out!

1859
01:39:07,907 --> 01:39:09,076
干
Fuck.

1860
01:39:13,145 --> 01:39:15,550
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

1861
01:39:31,398 --> 01:39:32,565
你没事吧
Are you all right?

1862
01:39:38,572 --> 01:39:40,279
-够了   -喔 老兄
-Okay.  -Oh, man.

1863
01:39:46,279 --> 01:39:47,779
哇
Whoa.

01:39:53,252 --> 01:39:54,788
好个大结局
Big finish.

1865
01:40:02,095 --> 01:40:03,696
这儿怎么了
What's going on here?

1866
01:40:03,697 --> 01:40:05,264
滚开 屎蛋
Get out of here, asshole.

1867
01:40:05,265 --> 01:40:08,202
我们来给你加个双重特效
We have to bring in your stunt double.

1868
01:40:14,774 --> 01:40:16,709
-谢谢       -你一定是在开玩笑吧 老兄
-Thank you. -You gotta be shittin' me, man!

1869
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:19,278
我坐在那边看 然后我在想"这到底是怎么了"
I'm sitting there looking, I'm like, "What is up with this?"

1870
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:20,446
你是认真的吗
Are you serious?

1871
01:40:20,447 --> 01:40:22,380
你们照顾Billy实在是太贴心了
You guys are so sweet to look after Billy.

1872
01:40:22,381 --> 01:40:23,784
-我的天啊     -你好吗
-Oh, my God!  -How are you?

1873
01:40:25,784 --> 01:40:26,823
啊
Ugh!

1874
01:40:31,957 --> 01:40:33,292
抱歉 Kelman
Oh, I'm sorry, Kelman.

1875
01:40:41,467 --> 01:40:45,139
<i>我的爱人在大洋的彼岸</i>
<i>My Bonnie lies over the ocean</i>

1876
01:40:46,139 --> 01:40:50,310
<i>我的爱人在海角天边</i>
<i>My Bonnie lies over the sea</i>

1877
01:40:51,310 --> 01:40:55,647
<i>我的爱人在大洋的彼岸</i>
<i>My Bonnie lies over the ocean</i>

1878
01:40:55,648 --> 01:40:59,153
<i>请将我的爱人带回我的身边</i>
<i>So bring back my Bonnie to me</i>
