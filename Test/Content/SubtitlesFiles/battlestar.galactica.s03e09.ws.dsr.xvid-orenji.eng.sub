00:00:20.19,00:00:22.59
Previously on Battlestar Galactica...

00:00:22.73,00:00:28.08
- I feel like I'm abandoning my post.[br]- Time to pack it in, Saul. You know it.

00:00:28.27,00:00:31.48
More than half the crew's[br]down on New Caprica already.

00:00:32.18,00:00:35.30
We're not really doing[br]too much up here anymore.

00:00:35.45,00:00:37.57
Good luck.

00:00:38.14,00:00:42.02
Oh, my Gods. It's a Cylon[br]fleet. They found us.

00:00:42.05,00:00:44.13
There's o­nly way that this mission ends...

00:00:44.68,00:00:49.52
and that's with the successful rescue[br]of our people off of New Caprica.

00:00:49.63,00:00:53.71
- You brought 'em home, Saul.[br]- Not all of them.

00:00:54.98,00:00:57.06
- What about us?[br]- There is no us.

00:00:57.09,00:01:01.26
All right? There is nothing[br]here. Do you get that? Nothing!

00:01:03.44,00:01:07.53
- Lee, when are you gonna get yourself a girl?[br]- I'm doing fine, thank you.

00:01:07.60,00:01:10.31
You're not still[br]frakkin' Dualla, are you?

00:01:10.49,00:01:12.48
I am proud to serve[br]with you, Lieutenant.

00:01:13.87,00:01:16.34
And to call you my wife.

00:01:16.65,00:01:19.79
I'm in a different place now.

00:01:20.09,00:01:23.55
I just want to hurt someone,[br]and it might as well be you.

00:01:31.56,00:01:33.86
Go! Go, Helo!

00:02:51.30,00:02:54.00
That was exactly what I needed.

00:03:00.98,00:03:03.49
Glad to be of service.

00:03:05.88,00:03:07.65
C'mon! C'mon!

00:03:12.74,00:03:15.26
- Damn it[br]- Looking for this?

00:03:17.81,00:03:20.19
Yeah.

00:03:20.82,00:03:23.79
Kara, I want you back.

00:03:24.43,00:03:28.91
 I want our marriage back. I want a real marriage. 

00:03:32.16,00:03:34.74
And what if I'm just not ready for that?

00:03:37.62,00:03:40.55
I don't know. Then I[br]guess you'll never be.

00:03:43.48,00:03:47.05
Maybe because I'm not what[br]you really want after all.

00:03:54.87,00:03:57.17
I'm late for the dance.

00:04:09.95,00:04:12.49
Don't forget your boots[br]on the way out, Sammy.

00:04:53.74,00:04:56.15
If it isn't the fighting Agathons, huh?

00:04:56.55,00:04:59.04
Starbuck, late to the party as usual.

00:04:59.56,00:05:02.47
At least I got here in time to[br]watch you kick the CAG's ass.

00:05:02.56,00:05:05.56
Lee, you got him. You just[br]got to keep your right up.

00:05:09.40,00:05:11.96
He's a tough little[br]frakker, I'll give him that.

00:05:12.41,00:05:15.04
- He's springing like he's got it in for me.[br]- Stay off the ropes.

00:05:15.07,00:05:17.43
Stick and move. Just stay off the ropes.

00:05:18.23,00:05:20.07
All right, you got him.

00:05:23.32,00:05:25.39
Come on, Lee! Kick his ass!

00:05:25.94,00:05:27.95
You got him! You got him!

00:05:38.47,00:05:41.80
Well, look at that. A couple months ago[br]you would've had to roll him into this ring.

00:05:41.89,00:05:45.57
Well, not anymore. You know, with a[br]cooler head, he might have half a chance.

00:06:20.17,00:06:22.21
Come on Helo!

00:06:40.39,00:06:42.53
Come on.

00:07:11.82,00:07:15.19
Fisher! Fisher, you're up!

00:07:18.27,00:07:20.45
Good fight.

00:07:21.95,00:07:24.53
Bit off a little more[br]than you can chew, huh?

00:07:30.25,00:07:32.79
Oh, come on, Lee. Don't be that way. 

00:07:34.05,00:07:36.13
Stick around. The night's young.

00:07:36.39,00:07:38.69
Well, I guess then you'll just[br]have to enjoy it without me.

00:07:39.87,00:07:42.29
Pulling your tags out so soon?

00:07:45.06,00:07:47.25
I'm done, Kara.

00:07:54.74,00:07:57.07
I'm not.

00:08:10.42,00:08:13.85
Now who's biting off more[br]than they can chew, Captain?

00:08:14.76,00:08:17.46
Not me from where I'm standing, Major.

00:08:31.52,00:08:33.85
Excuse me.

00:08:41.05,00:08:45.05
Battlestar Galactica - 3x09[br]Unfinished business

00:08:45.05,00:08:49.05
http://bsg.lamerone.net

00:09:28.12,00:09:30.10
I can't believe the[br]progress they've made.

00:09:30.59,00:09:32.70
You should've seen it a month ago.

00:09:33.79,00:09:35.77
Well, I'd still rather sleep[br]in a warm bunk every night...

00:09:35.86,00:09:38.59
then muck around... in this muck.

00:09:39.26,00:09:41.50
Bunk's gonna be plenty warm tonight.

00:09:43.30,00:09:46.42
- He said yes.[br]- He approved the transfer?

00:09:48.93,00:09:51.33
You two just don't know how[br]to keep a secret, do you?

00:09:52.18,00:09:54.95
So what, are you guys here to see[br]Baltar put a shovel in the ground?

00:09:55.76,00:09:58.12
"Join the celebration[br]as we break ground...

00:09:58.19,00:10:01.55
-  for a better tomorrow."[br]- Aw, it's such a load of crap.

00:10:01.96,00:10:03.92
There's an open bar.

00:10:04.08,00:10:07.18
Really? See, now why didn't you say so?

00:10:07.27,00:10:10.33
Lee, you gotta let your better half do the[br]talking for you, she gets right to the point.

00:10:11.74,00:10:14.36
Let's go find us a better tomorrow!

00:10:15.00,00:10:17.06
Excuse us.

00:10:22.39,00:10:25.32
Didn't expect to find[br]you playing in the sand.

00:10:26.98,00:10:29.13
It's not sand.

00:10:29.94,00:10:33.89
It's alluvial deposits. This[br]used to be the river mouth.

00:10:35.09,00:10:38.57
And you just had to take off your[br]shoes and play in the alluvial deposits.

00:10:39.58,00:10:41.60
How romantic.

00:10:44.76,00:10:47.77
- That's a nice color on you.[br]- Thank you.

00:10:51.76,00:10:53.99
It's good to see you, Laura.

00:10:54.87,00:10:56.99
You too, Bill.

00:11:10.15,00:11:12.15
There you are.

00:11:11.99,00:11:15.98
- Hey. How are you?[br]- My father was an avid fight fan.

00:11:16.29,00:11:19.36
I adored my father,[br]so I love a good fight.

00:11:31.71,00:11:34.42
I heard about your so-called dance.

00:11:35.39,00:11:37.67
Accidentally, I might add.

00:11:38.07,00:11:40.10
Don't take it personal.

00:11:40.42,00:11:44.74
- This is sort of a private tradition.[br]- Tradition?

00:11:45.11,00:11:47.76
There's a lot of[br]frustration aboard warships.

00:11:48.21,00:11:51.53
Arguments become grudges,[br]then end up being feuds.

00:11:51.97,00:11:54.72
This allows them to[br]let off some steam...

00:11:54.84,00:11:57.33
out in the open so[br]everybody can participate.

00:11:57.53,00:12:01.52
Rank doesn't matter. As long as[br]you throw your tags in the box...

00:12:01.53,00:12:03.75
everyone's fair game.

00:12:11.32,00:12:14.56
Next up is Hotdog!

00:12:15.41,00:12:18.69
Hotdog, get your butt up[br]here and pick a partner.

00:12:19.07,00:12:21.55
Did you throw your tags in there?

00:12:22.00,00:12:25.76
No. No. I wish.

00:12:26.91,00:12:29.05
All the frustrations that I have...

00:12:29.17,00:12:32.78
- Who's your partner, Hotdog?[br]- Starbuck.

00:12:34.13,00:12:36.18
You gotta be kidding me.

00:14:15.49,00:14:17.17
Thank you.

00:14:17.24,00:14:20.22
Let this day be remembered[br]as the day we broke ground...

00:14:20.60,00:14:22.79
for our new tomorrow.

00:14:31.44,00:14:33.78
But no, it gets better. Ok?

00:14:33.72,00:14:36.30
'Cause then they come[br]back to the locker room...

00:14:36.31,00:14:39.84
with a set of handcuffs and two straws!

00:14:53.15,00:14:55.98
Did I ever tell you how[br]glad I am I married you?

00:14:56.13,00:14:58.17
Not once.

00:14:58.23,00:15:01.19
Oh. Well, then I'll save[br]it for a special occasion.

00:15:03.03,00:15:05.07
Come here.

00:15:18.73,00:15:20.81
- Hey, honey.[br]- Hey, baby.

00:15:20.82,00:15:22.42
Hi.

00:15:31.06,00:15:34.38
We'll have the infrastructure[br]to deal with any unforeseen...

00:15:35.59,00:15:38.23
excuse me for just one moment. The finance[br]minister just came by, and I should really…

00:15:38.26,00:15:39.55
Go ahead.

00:15:45.92,00:15:48.73
Oh, my Gods. I didn't[br]think he'd ever leave.

00:15:48.90,00:15:50.96
He's a good kid.

00:15:51.72,00:15:53.81
Indeed.

00:15:56.31,00:15:59.22
- You say this stuff grows around here?[br]- Mmhmm.

00:16:01.73,00:16:04.55
In the mountains north of here[br]there's this little stream...

00:16:04.64,00:16:06.70
that comes down into this lake.

00:16:07.32,00:16:11.17
The water is so clear it's[br]like looking through glass.

00:16:12.30,00:16:15.16
I'm thinking of building a cabin.

00:16:27.13,00:16:29.24
That's good.

00:16:31.28,00:16:33.41
It is good.

00:16:39.13,00:16:41.28
That's a beautiful combination!

00:16:41.34,00:16:44.33
- What I miss?[br]- Grisky, you done that bird already?

00:16:44.42,00:16:48.06
No, the gyro's giving me trouble. Come[br]on, Chief, I'm the only one over there.

00:16:49.51,00:16:52.30
Frak it, get yourself a drink.

00:16:55.02,00:16:57.63
- Ship down, Chief.[br]- Yeah, we'll get it tomorrow.

00:16:57.76,00:16:59.94
I'm figuring I'll give'em a little R&R.

00:17:02.61,00:17:07.21
Congratulations. I may[br]be jumping the gun, but…

00:17:07.28,00:17:09.91
the first boy born on Galactica.

00:17:12.24,00:17:14.65
That's the thing I want[br]to talk to you about, sir.

00:17:15.99,00:17:18.10
Cally doesn't want him born here.

00:17:20.99,00:17:23.29
And neither do I. Not[br]if he has a chance to...

00:17:23.39,00:17:25.48
grow up breathing fresh air.

00:17:25.49,00:17:29.40
- What are you saying?[br]- Thank you. Well, we both would like to request...

00:17:29.45,00:17:32.94
to be relieved of duty[br]and settle on New Caprica.

00:17:33.11,00:17:35.18
No, no way.

00:17:35.47,00:17:38.04
You're both here for the duration.

00:18:01.08,00:18:05.19
- What?[br]- Can you hold these? Thank you.

00:18:24.09,00:18:26.14
Chief

00:18:27.42,00:18:29.96
Get your fat, lazy ass up here.

00:18:36.11,00:18:38.12
Helo.

00:18:46.42,00:18:48.86
- Make 'em tight.[br]- Yes, sir.

00:18:56.04,00:18:57.89
He's an old man, it's fine.

00:18:58.43,00:19:00.56
He's not serious, anyways.

00:19:08.70,00:19:10.80
Sure about this?

00:19:11.28,00:19:13.45
It's your funeral.

00:19:50.88,00:19:53.65
Get up, Chief. We're[br]just getting started.

00:19:56.13,00:20:00.65
You know, I was thinking... it's probably[br]better to have the baby on Galactica anyways.

00:20:02.04,00:20:05.86
You know, there's...[br]sickbay, doctors, medicine.

00:20:05.90,00:20:09.17
Yeah. No, it'll be better.

00:20:09.81,00:20:11.89
We'll be happier.

00:20:13.65,00:20:15.63
Yeah.

00:20:20.97,00:20:23.07
Come on, Admiral!

00:20:48.23,00:20:50.36
- Hey, honey.[br]- Hey, baby.

00:20:50.42,00:20:52.16
Hi.

00:21:24.42,00:21:26.68
Is this really it, Bill?

00:21:29.01,00:21:32.69
Is this how we're gonna spend[br]all the rest of our days?

00:21:56.92,00:21:59.73
Maybe we should just enjoy this.

00:22:03.41,00:22:05.50
I am.

00:22:06.03,00:22:09.41
No, no, I mean enjoy being[br]here on this planet...

00:22:09.57,00:22:11.82
as long as it lasts. I mean maybe...

00:22:12.97,00:22:16.46
the Cylons come back, maybe they[br]don't, but for now, right now...

00:22:18.27,00:22:20.48
We've got a break.

00:22:25.12,00:22:27.65
I've got people...

00:22:27.69,00:22:29.74
that want to get off the ship.

00:22:30.42,00:22:32.56
Move down here.

00:22:36.00,00:22:39.16
Can't say as I blame them. I[br]mean, what are you gonna do?

00:22:47.92,00:22:50.30
This how you fight your enemies, Chief?

00:22:50.82,00:22:52.96
This how you fight for your life?

00:22:54.27,00:22:57.12
No excuses. Show me you're a soldier.

00:22:57.63,00:22:59.67
Get up!

00:23:12.27,00:23:14.96
Come on! Nice, Admiral.

00:23:20.47,00:23:23.31
Is that what you want? Is[br]that what you want, Admiral?

00:23:28.63,00:23:30.69
Nice, Admiral.

00:23:30.87,00:23:32.96
The old man's got chops.

00:23:33.06,00:23:35.47
He knows when to make his[br]moves, when to hold back.

00:23:36.13,00:23:38.72
I wish I could say the same for his son.

00:23:40.17,00:23:42.22
Come on!

00:23:50.50,00:23:52.86
I bring offerings.

00:23:53.29,00:23:55.54
Just in time.

00:23:56.16,00:23:58.38
I was runnin' on bingo fuel.

00:23:59.37,00:24:01.34
Wow, look at that.

00:24:01.44,00:24:04.36
You literally drank[br]Anders under the table.

00:24:05.55,00:24:10.73
- Where's Dee?[br]- Oh, she... packed it in. To go pack.

00:24:14.94,00:24:17.20
Guess it's just you and me then.

00:24:19.91,00:24:22.09
Yep. It's just you and me.

00:24:29.15,00:24:31.28
Come on, dad!

00:25:05.67,00:25:08.29
That's bad. That's enough[br]already. You should quit.

00:25:10.91,00:25:13.01
Just stop the blood. 

00:25:13.19,00:25:16.06
Coagulant for the swelling[br]and bleeding come on.

00:25:16.65,00:25:19.29
You insist on doing this. You want[br]to do this. You're crazy, right?

00:25:21.85,00:25:23.76
- You want to do this?[br]- Yeah.

00:25:23.86,00:25:26.85
All right. Keep your guard up. He's[br]coming in wild. Get him with a left hook.

00:25:27.30,00:25:29.35
You wanna win?

00:25:30.13,00:25:32.15
I'm not gonna win.

00:25:38.44,00:25:40.77
Watch his jab. His jab's[br]killin' you, all right?

00:25:47.12,00:25:50.22
Chief, good morning. Morning, Cally.

00:25:50.60,00:25:53.22
- Admiral.[br]- I've been thinking about...

00:25:53.68,00:25:57.72
what you said. A Battlestar's[br]no place to raise a family.

00:25:58.22,00:26:02.33
So I'm gonna miss you, Chief.[br]I wanna wish you good luck.

00:26:09.04,00:26:11.11
Thank you, sir.

00:26:11.73,00:26:14.52
- My best to both of you.[br]- You mean it? Really?

00:26:15.40,00:26:18.19
-  Thank you.[br]- I want you guys to have at least a dozen.

00:26:19.45,00:26:21.60
We'll see about that.

00:27:50.42,00:27:52.90
When you stand on this deck...

00:27:53.44,00:27:55.54
you be ready to fight...

00:27:55.86,00:27:58.70
or you dishonor the[br]reason why we're here.

00:28:01.85,00:28:03.83
Now remember this:

00:28:04.01,00:28:06.07
when you fight a man...

00:28:06.64,00:28:08.71
he's not your friend.

00:28:13.41,00:28:15.80
Same goes when you lead men.

00:28:17.00,00:28:19.26
I forgot that once.

00:28:21.90,00:28:24.13
I let you get too close.

00:28:24.15,00:28:26.15
All of you.

00:28:26.83,00:28:29.06
I dropped my guard.

00:28:30.37,00:28:32.75
I gave some of you breaks...

00:28:32.88,00:28:34.97
let some of you go...

00:28:35.09,00:28:37.64
before the fight was really over.

00:28:39.28,00:28:42.30
I let this crew and this family...

00:28:43.91,00:28:46.09
disband.

00:28:50.34,00:28:52.89
And we paid the price in lives.

00:28:57.70,00:29:00.30
That can't happen again.

00:29:24.10,00:29:25.59
Grogosky.

00:29:26.23,00:29:29.00
You're with me. Let's get[br]that bird back on the line.

00:29:32.02,00:29:34.61
- Madam President.[br]- Admiral.

00:29:45.36,00:29:48.03
All right, this dance is over.

00:29:48.10,00:29:51.11
Get your booze and your dog[br]tags and let's get out of here.

00:29:56.65,00:30:01.07
- So what, you're just gonna call it?[br]- Not enough excitement for one night for you, Captain?

00:30:04.44,00:30:05.85
Ehy!

00:30:05.89,00:30:08.84
Ehy! Where the frak do[br]you think you're going?

00:30:11.12,00:30:13.14
It's over, Kara.

00:30:13.24,00:30:14.59
So what?

00:30:14.64,00:30:17.39
You have the guts to try and frak[br]another man's woman but not to fight one?

00:30:20.05,00:30:22.34
I wonder if Dee knew[br]what she was getting.

00:30:23.46,00:30:25.89
Think she would have[br]settled for sloppy seconds?

00:30:34.42,00:30:36.41
Truth stings, don't it?

00:30:36.46,00:30:38.55
You want a fight, Captain.

00:30:39.17,00:30:41.21
You got it.

00:31:14.05,00:31:15.59
What?

00:31:15.66,00:31:17.77
You afraid to hit me?

00:31:22.77,00:31:24.77
Or maybe you can't.

00:31:32.79,00:31:35.86
Check it out. It's a[br]great place for a house.

00:31:39.17,00:31:41.32
So you're really gonna give up flying.

00:31:41.74,00:31:43.79
Ah, flying's gonna suck now anyway.

00:31:44.05,00:31:46.27
Lots of training, endless CAPs.

00:31:46.55,00:31:48.61
The war's over.

00:31:48.75,00:31:50.88
So's all the good stuff.

00:32:00.62,00:32:02.60
Gimme a tour...

00:32:02.69,00:32:06.33
of the future life of Kara Anders.

00:32:09.29,00:32:11.36
I'm not getting married.

00:32:11.85,00:32:15.04
Well, then... then[br]what's the point, Kara?

00:32:17.27,00:32:19.38
I mean, you love him, right?

00:32:21.03,00:32:23.10
Where are we going with this, Lee?

00:32:24.94,00:32:27.00
Well, now, that's the[br]question isn't it...

00:32:28.11,00:32:30.11
where are we going?

00:32:31.52,00:32:33.82
I mean, what if this... this is it?

00:32:34.33,00:32:36.39
The rest of your life, Kara.

00:32:38.89,00:32:41.16
Is this how you want to spend it?

00:32:42.50,00:32:44.71
Is this who you want to spend it with?

00:33:00.22,00:33:03.52
- What's going on?[br]- What's it look like?

00:33:03.78,00:33:06.14
Looks like they're[br]trying to kill each other.

00:33:06.76,00:33:08.94
That's one perspective.

00:34:19.37,00:34:22.16
Well, that makes[br]things more complicated.

00:34:23.74,00:34:25.78
Yeah.

00:34:28.67,00:34:30.77
What are we gonna do?

00:34:34.36,00:34:36.41
What are we gonna do?

00:34:40.53,00:34:42.72
We accept it.

00:34:42.81,00:34:44.91
Tomorrow, I tell Dee.

00:34:45.18,00:34:47.33
You tell Sam.

00:34:47.42,00:34:49.47
Just like that? 

00:34:49.49,00:34:51.54
Just like that.

00:34:52.58,00:34:54.67
I don't know.

00:34:54.89,00:34:56.97
Yeah, we tell them how we feel.

00:34:57.04,00:34:59.29
We shout it to the skies.

00:34:59.90,00:35:01.56
Yeah, right.

00:35:01.65,00:35:03.31
Well, you…

00:35:03.37,00:35:05.62
you don't think I will?

00:35:09.18,00:35:11.22
Lee.

00:35:14.82,00:35:18.76
My name is Lee Adama...

00:35:18.88,00:35:23.06
and I love Kara Thrace!

00:35:25.76,00:35:27.50
Calm down.

00:35:28.49,00:35:32.64
Well, it's not like anybody'll hear.[br]We're in your cabin in the forest, right?

00:35:34.57,00:35:38.04
I love Kara Thrace! And I don't care...

00:35:38.12,00:35:40.85
who frakking knows!

00:35:42.53,00:35:45.01
Oh, you're crazy.

00:35:45.05,00:35:46.39
Get down.

00:35:46.42,00:35:49.21
Well, come on. I'm not gonna stop[br]until you get up and do it too.

00:35:49.80,00:35:51.82
I can't.

00:35:51.91,00:35:53.62
I'm gonna... okay, here we go again.

00:35:53.64,00:35:56.04
- Lee Adama...[br]- Ok, ok, ok, ok.

00:36:00.67,00:36:02.75
Ok.

00:36:08.67,00:36:12.40
Kara Thrace loves Lee Adama!

00:36:33.27,00:36:36.93
Get up! Starbuck get[br]up, you can do this.

00:37:18.82,00:37:20.83
Morning, Admiral. 

00:37:22.93,00:37:25.12
You look like you had a good time.

00:37:25.97,00:37:28.12
Yeah, it was some party.

00:37:28.50,00:37:32.27
Yeah, well, it's been a hell of a morning[br]too. You missed all the excitement.

00:37:32.46,00:37:34.82
- There's problems upstairs?[br]- No.

00:37:35.61,00:37:39.13
No, good things. Kara got married.

00:37:39.19,00:37:41.17
Believe that?

00:37:41.21,00:37:43.51
- What?[br]- Yep, 'bout an hour ago.

00:37:44.15,00:37:46.16
Found herself a priest...

00:37:46.20,00:37:48.35
went down by the river and got married.

00:37:52.94,00:37:55.13
You okay?

00:38:10.53,00:38:12.55
Can you believe that?

00:38:14.46,00:38:16.54
Well, she deserves it, man.

00:38:16.64,00:38:18.76
We all deserve to be happy.

00:38:18.86,00:38:21.32
I also gave her[br]permission to muster out...

00:38:21.39,00:38:23.65
along with Tyrol and Cally...

00:38:24.27,00:38:28.02
a few of the others, so it'll be up to[br]us to make sure there's no mass exodus.

00:39:13.29,00:39:16.12
Hey, man. Did you hear the news?

00:39:17.55,00:39:20.80
We're hitched. We got[br]married. Can you believe it?

00:39:21.62,00:39:22.76
No.

00:39:22.85,00:39:24.82
- No, I can't believe it.[br]- Yeah.

00:39:24.87,00:39:27.92
No, it was crazy. She comes[br]down and she wakes me up.

00:39:28.12,00:39:31.16
She pops the question, she drags me[br]down to the priest and, bang, like that.

00:39:31.25,00:39:33.33
We're married.

00:39:35.05,00:39:37.20
So it was your idea.

00:39:39.23,00:39:40.89
Yeah.

00:39:40.93,00:39:42.73
It was my idea.

00:39:42.78,00:39:45.56
Do you guys… Do you guys want a minute...

00:39:45.61,00:39:47.67
to...

00:39:47.94,00:39:49.89
you know, talk?

00:39:50.22,00:39:52.31
- Congratulations, Sam.[br]- Yeah.

00:39:52.95,00:39:55.09
And good luck.

00:39:56.21,00:39:58.24
You're gonna need it.

00:40:22.15,00:40:24.85
Watch that pretty face! 

00:41:43.89,00:41:45.95
I'm outta here.

00:42:02.77,00:42:04.86
I missed you.

00:42:10.50,00:42:12.60
I missed you too.

00:42:13.16,00:42:15.23
I missed you too.
