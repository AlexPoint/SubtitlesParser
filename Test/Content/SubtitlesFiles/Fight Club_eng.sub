1
00:00:36,496 --> 00:00:38,487
(rock music)

2
00:01:55,256 --> 00:01:57,247
(music fades)

3
00:01:59,456 --> 00:02:02,448
(man) People always ask me
if l know Tyler Durden.

4
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:04,331
Three minutes.

5
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,646
This is it. Ground zero.

6
00:02:06,736 --> 00:02:10,251
- Do you have a speech for the occasion?
- (mumbles)

7
00:02:10,336 --> 00:02:13,726
With a gun barrel between your teeth,
you speak only in vowels.

8
00:02:13,816 --> 00:02:15,807
l can't think of anything.

9
00:02:15,896 --> 00:02:19,605
For a second, l forget about
Tyler's controlled demolition thing...

10
00:02:19,696 --> 00:02:21,766
..and l wonder how clean that gun is.

11
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:23,847
lt's getting exciting now.

12
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,973
That old thing,
how you always hurt the one you love.

13
00:02:27,056 --> 00:02:29,047
Well, it works both ways.

14
00:02:29,136 --> 00:02:33,254
We have front-row seats
for this theatre ofmass destruction.

15
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:35,975
The Demolitions Committee
of Project Mayhem...

16
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:39,366
..wrapped the foundations
of 12 buildings with explosives.

17
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:43,327
ln two minutes,
primary charges will blow base charges...

18
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:46,647
..and a few blocks will be reduced
to smouldering rubble.

19
00:02:46,736 --> 00:02:49,648
l know this because Tyler knows this.

20
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:52,967
Two and a half.
Think of everything we've accomplished.

21
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:58,210
Suddenly l realise that all of this,
the gun, the bombs, the revolution,...

22
00:02:58,296 --> 00:03:01,845
..has got something to do
with a girl named Marla Singer.

23
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,176
Bob. Bob had bitch tits.

24
00:03:06,256 --> 00:03:10,249
This was a support group
for men with testicular cancer.

25
00:03:10,336 --> 00:03:13,487
The big moosie slobbering all over me,
that was Bob.

26
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:15,646
We're still men.

27
00:03:15,736 --> 00:03:17,852
(flatly) Yes, we're men.

28
00:03:17,936 --> 00:03:20,006
Men is what we are.

29
00:03:20,096 --> 00:03:23,406
Bob had had his testicles removed.
Then hormone therapy.

30
00:03:23,496 --> 00:03:27,125
He developed bitch tits because
his testosterone was too high...

31
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:29,252
..and his body upped the oestrogen.

32
00:03:29,336 --> 00:03:32,885
- That was where l fiit...
- They'll have to drain my pecs again.

33
00:03:32,976 --> 00:03:35,331
..between those huge sweating tits...

34
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:39,489
..that hung enormous,
the way you'd think of God's as big.

35
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:41,692
OK, you cry now.

36
00:03:41,776 --> 00:03:44,210
No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.

37
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,050
For six months, l couldn't sleep.

38
00:03:48,136 --> 00:03:50,570
(echoing) l couldn't sleep...

39
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,726
With insomnia, nothing's real.

40
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,807
Everything's far away.

41
00:03:55,696 --> 00:03:58,005
Everything's a copy ofa copy...

42
00:03:58,096 --> 00:04:00,052
..of a copy.

43
00:04:02,216 --> 00:04:07,574
When deep space exploration ramps up,
it'll be the corporations that name everything.

44
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:09,647
The lBM Stellar Sphere.

45
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:11,972
The Microsoft Galaxy.

46
00:04:12,056 --> 00:04:14,012
The Planet Starbucks.

47
00:04:14,576 --> 00:04:17,488
l need you out of town this week
to cover some red flags.

48
00:04:17,576 --> 00:04:21,012
lt must have been Tuesday.
He had on his cornflower blue tie.

49
00:04:21,096 --> 00:04:25,533
You want me to deprioritise my reports
until you advise of a status upgrade?

50
00:04:25,616 --> 00:04:30,007
Prioritise these. Here's your flight coupons.
Call me if there's any snags.

51
00:04:30,096 --> 00:04:33,771
He was full ofpep.
Must have had his grande latte enema.

52
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:39,805
Like so many others, l had become
a slave to the lkea nesting instinct.

53
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:42,171
Uh... yes. l'd like to order...

54
00:04:42,256 --> 00:04:44,406
..the Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.

55
00:04:44,496 --> 00:04:46,532
- Please hold.
- Anything clever,...

56
00:04:46,616 --> 00:04:50,814
..like a coffee table in the shape ofa yin-yang,
l had to have it.

57
00:04:51,816 --> 00:04:54,091
The Klipsk personal offiice unit.

58
00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:56,371
The Hovetrekke home exerbike.

59
00:04:56,736 --> 00:05:00,126
Or the Ohamshab sofa
with the Strinne green stripe pattern.

60
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:05,449
Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of
environmentally-friendly unbleached paper.

61
00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:08,255
l'd flip through catalogues and wonder...

62
00:05:08,336 --> 00:05:11,248
.. ''What kind of dining set
defiines me as a person?''

63
00:05:11,336 --> 00:05:15,932
l had it all. Even the glass dishes
with tiny bubbles and imperfections,...

64
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:20,885
..proof that they were crafted by the honest,
hard-working, indigenous peoples of...

65
00:05:20,976 --> 00:05:23,809
- (woman) Please hold.
- ..wherever.

66
00:05:24,296 --> 00:05:26,332
We used to read pornography.

67
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,135
Now it was the Horchow collection.

68
00:05:29,216 --> 00:05:32,447
- No. You can't die of insomnia.
- What about narcolepsy?

69
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:34,811
l nod off, l wake up in strange places.

70
00:05:34,896 --> 00:05:36,887
l have no idea how l got there.

71
00:05:36,976 --> 00:05:40,605
- You need to lighten up.
- Can you please just give me something?

72
00:05:40,696 --> 00:05:44,166
Red and blue Tuinals, lipstick-red Seconals...

73
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:47,852
No. You need healthy, natural sleep.

74
00:05:48,576 --> 00:05:51,886
Chew some valerian root
and get more exercise.

75
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:55,847
Hey, come on.

76
00:05:55,936 --> 00:05:57,927
- l'm in pain.
- You wanna see pain?

77
00:05:58,016 --> 00:06:00,450
Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.

78
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:03,494
See the guys with testicular cancer.

79
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:05,567
That's pain.

80
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:14,327
(children singing)

81
00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:24,092
l always wanted three kids...
two boys and a girl.

82
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,451
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.

83
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:30,365
We never could agree on anything.

84
00:06:30,696 --> 00:06:32,414
Well, l... She...

85
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:34,885
She had her first child last week.

86
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:37,126
A girl.

87
00:06:37,216 --> 00:06:40,333
With... With her... With her new husband.

88
00:06:41,136 --> 00:06:43,127
(man whispers) Fuck!

89
00:06:44,376 --> 00:06:46,367
Thank God, you know...

90
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:48,447
l'm glad for her.

91
00:06:49,216 --> 00:06:52,049
(sobs) She deserves...

92
00:06:55,736 --> 00:06:59,411
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

93
00:06:59,496 --> 00:07:01,487
Thank you, Thomas.

94
00:07:01,576 --> 00:07:04,886
l look around this room,
and l see a lot of courage.

95
00:07:04,976 --> 00:07:06,967
And that gives me strength.

96
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:09,286
We give each other strength.

97
00:07:09,376 --> 00:07:11,571
lt's time for the one-on-ones.

98
00:07:12,136 --> 00:07:16,368
So let's all of us follow Thomas's example
and really open ourselves up.

99
00:07:16,456 --> 00:07:18,447
Could you find a partner?

100
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:23,573
And this is how l met the big moosie.

101
00:07:25,176 --> 00:07:28,248
His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.

102
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,289
Knees together. Those awkward little steps.

103
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:40,332
- My name is Bob.
- Bob?

104
00:07:40,976 --> 00:07:43,171
Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.

105
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:46,771
You know that chest expansion programme
on late-night TV?

106
00:07:46,856 --> 00:07:48,847
That was his idea.

107
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:50,927
(sobbing) l was a juicer.

108
00:07:51,016 --> 00:07:53,052
You know, using steroids?

109
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:55,525
Diabonal and...

110
00:07:55,616 --> 00:07:57,846
..Wisterol.

111
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:01,690
Oh, they use that on racehorses,
for Christ sakes.

112
00:08:02,176 --> 00:08:04,167
And now l'm bankrupt.

113
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:07,007
l'm divorced.

114
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:09,727
My two grown kids...

115
00:08:10,576 --> 00:08:13,136
..won't even return my phone calls.

116
00:08:13,216 --> 00:08:18,085
Strangers with this kind ofhonesty
make me go a big, rubbery one.

117
00:08:19,816 --> 00:08:21,807
Go ahead,... Cornelius.

118
00:08:21,896 --> 00:08:23,887
You can cry.

119
00:08:36,896 --> 00:08:38,887
(starts snivelling)

120
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:42,286
And then... something happened.
l let go.

121
00:08:42,376 --> 00:08:44,367
That's really good.

122
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:46,447
Lost in oblivion.

123
00:08:46,536 --> 00:08:48,731
Dark and silent and complete.

124
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:55,165
l found freedom.
Losing all hope was freedom.

125
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,527
(Bob whispers) lt's OK.

126
00:09:01,696 --> 00:09:03,812
Babies don't sleep this well.

127
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,764
l became addicted.

128
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,887
lf l didn't say anything...

129
00:09:24,976 --> 00:09:27,536
..people always assumed the worst.

130
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:34,168
They cried harder... then l cried harder.

131
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:47,209
Now we're going to open the green door,
the heart chakra...

132
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,287
l wasn't really dying.

133
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,055
l wasn't host to cancer or parasites.

134
00:09:52,936 --> 00:09:56,975
l was the warm little centre
that the life of this world crowded around.

135
00:09:57,616 --> 00:10:00,449
lmagine your pain
as a white ball of healing light.

136
00:10:00,536 --> 00:10:04,495
lt moves over your body, healing you.

137
00:10:04,576 --> 00:10:07,932
Now keep this going. Remember to breathe...

138
00:10:08,016 --> 00:10:11,565
..and step forward
through the back door of the room.

139
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:14,412
Where does it lead?

140
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:16,532
To your cave.

141
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,413
Step forward...

142
00:10:18,496 --> 00:10:20,612
..into your cave.

143
00:10:20,696 --> 00:10:22,687
That's right.

144
00:10:22,776 --> 00:10:26,086
(echoing) You're going deeper into your cave.

145
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:28,767
And you're going to find...

146
00:10:28,856 --> 00:10:30,847
..your power animal.

147
00:10:32,896 --> 00:10:34,170
(penguin) Slide.

148
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:38,170
(penguin giggles)

149
00:10:44,816 --> 00:10:46,807
Every evening l died.

150
00:10:47,936 --> 00:10:50,496
And every evening l was born again.

151
00:10:51,056 --> 00:10:53,047
Resurrected.

152
00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:59,049
Bob loved me because he thought
my testicles were removed too.

153
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:01,809
Being there, pressed against his tits,...

154
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:03,887
..ready to cry.

155
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:06,536
This was my vacation.

156
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:10,294
And she...

157
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:12,936
..ruined everything.

158
00:11:13,016 --> 00:11:15,007
This is cancer, right?

159
00:11:17,816 --> 00:11:19,932
This chick, Marla Singer,...

160
00:11:20,016 --> 00:11:22,576
..did not have testicular cancer.

161
00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:24,647
She was a liar.

162
00:11:24,736 --> 00:11:26,727
She had no diseases at all.

163
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:30,445
l had seen her at Free And Clear,
my blood parasites group, Thursdays.

164
00:11:30,536 --> 00:11:33,846
Then at Hope,
my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.

165
00:11:34,336 --> 00:11:39,091
And again, at Seize The Day,
my tuberculosis, Friday night.

166
00:11:40,176 --> 00:11:42,087
Marla,...

167
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:44,565
..the big tourist.

168
00:11:44,656 --> 00:11:46,647
Her lie reflected my lie.

169
00:11:47,176 --> 00:11:49,167
And suddenly, l felt nothing.

170
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:52,726
l couldn't cry. So once again,...

171
00:11:52,816 --> 00:11:54,807
..l couldn't sleep.

172
00:12:05,336 --> 00:12:07,725
Next group, after guided meditation,...

173
00:12:07,816 --> 00:12:11,092
..after we open our heart chakras,
when it's time to hug,...

174
00:12:11,176 --> 00:12:14,213
..l'm gonna grab that bitch,
Marla Singer, and scream.

175
00:12:14,296 --> 00:12:18,130
Marla, you liar!
You big tourist, l need this! Now, get out!

176
00:12:20,136 --> 00:12:22,411
l hadn't slept in four days.

177
00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:24,293
(TV) We'lljust let that dry...

178
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:27,686
When you have insomnia,
you're never really asleep.

179
00:12:27,776 --> 00:12:30,131
And you're never really awake.

180
00:12:31,256 --> 00:12:33,645
To begin tonight's communion,...

181
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:36,375
..Chloe would like to say a few words.

182
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:39,294
Oh, yeah. Chloe.

183
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:44,891
Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton
would look ifyou made it walk around...

184
00:12:44,976 --> 00:12:46,967
..being extra nice to everybody.

185
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,407
Well, l'm still here.

186
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:51,812
But l don't know for how long.

187
00:12:52,616 --> 00:12:55,608
That's as much certainty
as anyone can give me.

188
00:12:55,696 --> 00:12:57,573
But l've got some good news.

189
00:12:57,656 --> 00:13:01,251
l no longer have any fear of death.

190
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:08,611
But... l am in a pretty lonely place.

191
00:13:09,616 --> 00:13:11,607
No-one will have sex with me.

192
00:13:12,736 --> 00:13:16,934
l'm so close to the end,
and all l want is to get laid for the last time.

193
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:20,846
l have pornographic movies
in my apartment,...

194
00:13:20,936 --> 00:13:24,485
- ..and lubricants and amyl nitrite.
- Thank you, Chloe.

195
00:13:25,176 --> 00:13:27,212
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.

196
00:13:27,296 --> 00:13:29,332
(all) Thank you, Chloe.

197
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:35,731
Now, let's ready ourselves
for guided meditation.

198
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:40,047
You're standing at the entrance of your cave.

199
00:13:40,536 --> 00:13:43,846
You step inside your cave and you walk...

200
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:46,928
if l did have a tumour, l'd name it Marla.

201
00:13:47,936 --> 00:13:49,847
Marla.

202
00:13:49,936 --> 00:13:54,214
The scratch on the roof ofyour mouth
that would heal ifyou could stop tonguing it.

203
00:13:54,296 --> 00:13:56,287
But you can't.

204
00:13:57,176 --> 00:13:59,929
(group leader)
..deeper into your cave as you walk.

205
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:03,406
(echoing) You feel
a healing energy all around you.

206
00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:07,927
Now fiind your power animal.

207
00:14:10,696 --> 00:14:12,652
Slide.

208
00:14:16,016 --> 00:14:19,292
(group leader) OK. Let's partner up.

209
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:21,606
Pick someone special to you tonight.

210
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,567
Hey.

211
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,927
- We need to talk.
- Sure.

212
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:38,527
- l'm onto you.
- What?

213
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:41,608
Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.

214
00:14:41,696 --> 00:14:43,414
Sorry?

215
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:48,286
ln the Tibetan-philosophy, Sylvia-Plath
sense of the word, l know we're all dying.

216
00:14:48,376 --> 00:14:52,415
- But you're not dying the way Chloe is.
- So?

217
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,967
So you're a tourist.

218
00:14:55,056 --> 00:14:59,095
l've seen you. l saw you at melanoma,
l saw you at tuberculosis.

219
00:14:59,176 --> 00:15:01,565
l saw you at testicular cancer!

220
00:15:01,656 --> 00:15:03,248
l saw you practising this.

221
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,645
- Practising what?
- Telling me off.

222
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:09,411
ls it going as well as you hoped,... Rupert?

223
00:15:09,496 --> 00:15:11,214
l'll expose you.

224
00:15:11,296 --> 00:15:13,287
Go ahead. l'll expose you.

225
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:16,769
(leader)
Come together. Let yourselves cry.

226
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,407
(sobs)

227
00:15:23,496 --> 00:15:25,487
Oh, God. Why are you doing this?

228
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:28,249
lt's cheaper than a movie
and there's free coffee.

229
00:15:28,336 --> 00:15:30,975
Look, this is important.
These are my groups.

230
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,092
l've been coming for over a year.

231
00:15:33,176 --> 00:15:36,248
- Why do you do it?
- l don't know.

232
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:40,011
When people think you're dying,
they listen to you instead of...

233
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:42,974
lnstead of waiting for their turn to speak.

234
00:15:44,216 --> 00:15:46,207
Yeah. Yeah.

235
00:15:47,336 --> 00:15:50,089
Share yourself... completely.

236
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:52,847
Look, you don't want to get into this.

237
00:15:52,936 --> 00:15:54,927
- lt becomes an addiction.
- Really?

238
00:15:55,016 --> 00:15:59,089
l'm not kidding. l can't cry
if another faker is present, and l need this.

239
00:15:59,176 --> 00:16:01,167
You gotta find somewhere else to go.

240
00:16:01,256 --> 00:16:04,692
Candystripe a cancer ward.
lt's not my problem.

241
00:16:07,696 --> 00:16:09,687
No, wait a second. Hold on.

242
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:11,767
We'll split up the week, OK?

243
00:16:11,856 --> 00:16:13,972
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.

244
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:17,048
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn't go over at all.

245
00:16:17,136 --> 00:16:20,287
OK. Good. Fine.
Testicular cancer should be no contest.

246
00:16:20,376 --> 00:16:24,130
Technically, l have more right to be there.
You still have your balls.

247
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,491
- You're kidding.
- l dunno. Am l?

248
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:28,535
No. No.

249
00:16:28,616 --> 00:16:31,130
- What do you want?
- l'll take the parasites.

250
00:16:31,216 --> 00:16:33,889
You can't have both.
Take the blood parasites.

251
00:16:33,976 --> 00:16:38,128
- l want brain parasites.
- l'll take the blood but l want brain dementia.

252
00:16:38,216 --> 00:16:40,855
- l want that.
- You can't have the whole brain.

253
00:16:40,936 --> 00:16:43,325
So far, you have four. l only have two.

254
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:47,170
OK. Take both the parasites. They're yours.

255
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,451
Now we both have three...

256
00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:54,616
Hey! You left half your clothes.

257
00:16:55,936 --> 00:16:57,927
(tyres screech)

258
00:16:58,016 --> 00:17:00,007
(car horn)

259
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:12,526
- What, are you selling those?
- Yes!

260
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,607
l'm selling some clothes!

261
00:17:14,696 --> 00:17:16,687
So! We each have three. That's six.

262
00:17:16,776 --> 00:17:19,495
What about the seventh day?
l want bowel cancer.

263
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:21,567
The girl had done her homework.

264
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:23,647
No. No. l want bowel cancer.

265
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:26,287
That's your favourite too?

266
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:29,732
- Tried to slip it by me, eh?
- Look, we'll split it.

267
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:31,807
Take the first and third Sunday.

268
00:17:34,176 --> 00:17:35,973
Deal.

269
00:17:38,456 --> 00:17:40,686
Looks like this is goodbye.

270
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:42,812
Let's not make a big thing out of it.

271
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,251
How's this for not making a big thing?

272
00:17:48,576 --> 00:17:50,328
Hey, Marla!

273
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:52,686
Marla!

274
00:17:52,776 --> 00:17:55,244
Maybe we should exchange numbers.

275
00:17:55,336 --> 00:17:57,167
Should we?

276
00:17:57,256 --> 00:18:01,169
- We might wanna switch nights.
- OK.

277
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:08,570
This is how l met Marla Singer.

278
00:18:10,216 --> 00:18:14,289
Marla's philosophy oflife
was that she might die at any moment.

279
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:16,571
The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.

280
00:18:16,656 --> 00:18:20,535
lt doesn't have your name!
Who are you? Cornelius? Rupert?

281
00:18:20,616 --> 00:18:24,404
Travis? Any of the stupid names
you give each night?

282
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:29,247
You wake up at SeaTac.

283
00:18:29,336 --> 00:18:32,169
SFO. LAX.

284
00:18:32,256 --> 00:18:34,531
You wake up at O'Hare.

285
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:36,652
Dallas Fort Worth.

286
00:18:36,736 --> 00:18:38,613
BWl.

287
00:18:38,696 --> 00:18:42,325
Pacifiic. Mountain. Central.
Lose an hour. Gain an hour.

288
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:46,125
The check-in for that flight
isn't for another two hours, sir.

289
00:18:46,216 --> 00:18:49,367
This is your life,
and it's ending one minute at a time.

290
00:18:49,456 --> 00:18:52,334
You wake up at Air Harbor lnternational.

291
00:18:53,696 --> 00:18:57,371
if you wake up at a different time,
in a different place,...

292
00:18:57,456 --> 00:19:00,016
..could you wake up as a different person?

293
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:02,087
Everywhere l travel,...

294
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:04,326
..tiny life.

295
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,850
Single-serving sugar and cream.

296
00:19:06,936 --> 00:19:08,654
Single pat ofbutter.

297
00:19:08,736 --> 00:19:11,455
The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.

298
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:13,413
Shampoo-conditioner combos.

299
00:19:13,496 --> 00:19:17,205
Sample-package mouthwash.
Tiny bars ofsoap.

300
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:21,005
The people l meet on each flight,...

301
00:19:21,096 --> 00:19:23,132
..they're single-serving friends.

302
00:19:23,216 --> 00:19:26,765
Between takeoffand landing,
we have our time together.

303
00:19:26,856 --> 00:19:29,006
That's all we get.

304
00:19:29,096 --> 00:19:30,927
(TV) Welcome!

305
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:36,929
On a long enough time line,
the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.

306
00:19:37,016 --> 00:19:40,611
l was a recall coordinator.
Myjob was to apply the formula.

307
00:19:40,696 --> 00:19:42,971
The infant went through the windshield.

308
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:46,969
A new car built by my company
leaves somewhere travelling at 60 mph.

309
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:49,047
The rear differential locks up.

310
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:52,524
The teenager's braces
are stuck to the ashtray.

311
00:19:52,616 --> 00:19:54,891
Might make a good anti-smoking ad.

312
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:58,332
The car crashes and burns
with everyone trapped inside.

313
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,611
Now, should we initiate a recall?

314
00:20:00,696 --> 00:20:02,687
The father must have been huge.

315
00:20:02,776 --> 00:20:05,848
See where the fat burned to the seat?
The polyester shirt?

316
00:20:05,936 --> 00:20:07,847
Very modern art.

317
00:20:07,936 --> 00:20:10,325
Take the number of vehicles in the fiield, A.

318
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,010
Multiply it by the probable rate offailure, B.

319
00:20:13,096 --> 00:20:16,725
Multiply the result by
the average out-of-court settlement, C.

320
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,807
A x B x C...

321
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:20,847
..equals X.

322
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:23,404
lf X is less than the cost of a recall,...

323
00:20:23,496 --> 00:20:25,452
..we don't do one.

324
00:20:25,536 --> 00:20:28,608
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?

325
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:30,527
You wouldn't believe.

326
00:20:31,936 --> 00:20:34,370
Which car company do you work for?

327
00:20:34,456 --> 00:20:36,447
A major one.

328
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:42,610
Every time the plane banked too sharply
on takeoff or landing,...

329
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:45,847
..l prayed for a crash or a midair collision.

330
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:47,975
Anything.

331
00:20:56,496 --> 00:21:00,045
Life insurance pays off triple
if you die on a business trip.

332
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:06,047
''lf you are seated in an emergency exit row...

333
00:21:06,136 --> 00:21:09,492
..and would be unable or unwilling
to perform the duties...

334
00:21:09,576 --> 00:21:13,854
..listed on the safety card, please
ask a flight attendant to reseat you.''

335
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:17,532
lt's a lot of responsibility.

336
00:21:17,616 --> 00:21:19,732
Wanna switch seats?

337
00:21:19,816 --> 00:21:23,126
No. l'm not sure
l'm the man for that particular job.

338
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:27,414
An exit-door procedure at 30,000ft. Mm-hm.

339
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:29,487
The illusion of safety.

340
00:21:29,736 --> 00:21:31,727
Yeah. l guess so.

341
00:21:31,816 --> 00:21:34,614
You know why
they put oxygen masks on planes?

342
00:21:34,696 --> 00:21:39,053
- So you can breathe.
- Oxygen gets you high.

343
00:21:40,136 --> 00:21:43,526
ln a catastrophic emergency,
you take giant panic breaths.

344
00:21:43,616 --> 00:21:46,005
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.

345
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,291
You accept your fate.

346
00:21:48,896 --> 00:21:50,852
lt's all right here.

347
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:53,973
Emergency water landing, 600mph.

348
00:21:54,056 --> 00:21:56,775
Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.

349
00:21:56,856 --> 00:21:58,847
That's um...

350
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:02,211
That's an interesting theory.

351
00:22:04,136 --> 00:22:06,172
- What do you do?
- What do you mean?

352
00:22:06,256 --> 00:22:08,247
What do you do for a living?

353
00:22:08,336 --> 00:22:11,373
Why? So you can pretend you're interested?

354
00:22:13,936 --> 00:22:15,335
OK.

355
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:18,169
You have
a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.

356
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:23,287
We have the exact same briefcase.

357
00:22:24,096 --> 00:22:26,007
Soap.

358
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:29,645
- Sorry?
- l make and l sell soap.

359
00:22:29,736 --> 00:22:32,011
The yardstick of civilisation.

360
00:22:32,536 --> 00:22:34,413
And this is how l met...

361
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,248
Tyler Durden.

362
00:22:36,336 --> 00:22:41,364
Did you know if you mix gasoline and
frozen orange juice, you can make napalm?

363
00:22:41,456 --> 00:22:44,289
- No, l did not. ls that true?
- That's right.

364
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:48,051
One can make all kinds of explosives
with simple household items.

365
00:22:48,136 --> 00:22:50,491
- Really?
- lf one was so inclined.

366
00:22:55,256 --> 00:23:00,125
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting
single-serving friend l have ever met.

367
00:23:01,936 --> 00:23:05,895
- Everything on a plane is single-serving...
- Oh, l get it. Very clever.

368
00:23:05,976 --> 00:23:07,455
Thank you.

369
00:23:07,536 --> 00:23:09,572
How's it working out for you?

370
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:12,295
- What?
- Being clever?

371
00:23:12,376 --> 00:23:14,651
Great.

372
00:23:14,736 --> 00:23:17,614
Keep it up, then. Right up.

373
00:23:18,736 --> 00:23:20,806
(sighs) A question of etiquette.

374
00:23:20,896 --> 00:23:23,774
As l pass, do l give you the ass or the crotch?

375
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:32,766
How l came to live with Tyler is...

376
00:23:32,856 --> 00:23:36,929
Airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage.

377
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:48,773
- Was it ticking?
- Throwers know modern bombs don't tick.

378
00:23:48,856 --> 00:23:51,893
- Sorry, throwers?
- Baggage handlers.

379
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:54,126
But when a suitcase vibrates,...

380
00:23:54,216 --> 00:23:56,810
..the throwers have got to call the police.

381
00:23:56,896 --> 00:24:00,252
- My suitcase was vibrating?
- Nine times out of ten...

382
00:24:00,336 --> 00:24:02,327
..it's an electric razor.

383
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:04,452
But... every once in a while...

384
00:24:07,256 --> 00:24:09,247
lt's a dildo.

385
00:24:09,976 --> 00:24:13,889
lt's company policy never to imply
ownership in the event of a dildo.

386
00:24:13,976 --> 00:24:17,685
We have to use the indefinite article,
a dildo, never...

387
00:24:17,776 --> 00:24:19,767
..your dildo.

388
00:24:19,856 --> 00:24:21,847
l don't own...

389
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:27,408
l had everything in that suitcase.
My CK shirts.

390
00:24:27,496 --> 00:24:30,533
My DKNY shoes. My AX ties.

391
00:24:32,136 --> 00:24:34,366
Never mind.

392
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:38,770
(man outside) Hey! That's my car!

393
00:24:41,736 --> 00:24:43,772
(sirens)

394
00:24:44,856 --> 00:24:46,733
Home was a condo on the 15.th floor...

395
00:24:46,816 --> 00:24:49,728
..of a fiiling cabinet
for widows and professionals.

396
00:24:49,816 --> 00:24:52,330
The walls were solid concrete.

397
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:54,407
A foot of concrete is important...

398
00:24:54,496 --> 00:24:58,569
..when your next-door neighbour
has to watch game shows at full volume.

399
00:24:58,656 --> 00:25:02,365
Or when a blast of debris
that used to be your personal effects...

400
00:25:02,456 --> 00:25:06,335
..blows out ofyour windows
and sails flaming into the night.

401
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:08,532
(helicopter hovering)

402
00:25:12,536 --> 00:25:14,731
l suppose these things happen.

403
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:25,927
(sirens)

404
00:25:27,056 --> 00:25:29,047
There's... nothing up there.

405
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:32,367
You can't go into the unit. Police orders.

406
00:25:40,696 --> 00:25:43,130
Do you have somebody you can call?

407
00:25:43,216 --> 00:25:45,252
How embarrassing.

408
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:48,089
A houseful of condiments and no food.

409
00:25:57,136 --> 00:26:00,765
The police later told me
the pilot light might have gone out...

410
00:26:01,736 --> 00:26:04,569
..letting outjust a little bit ofgas.

411
00:26:04,656 --> 00:26:06,806
That gas could have fiilled the condo.

412
00:26:06,896 --> 00:26:10,286
1700 square feet with high ceilings
for days and days.

413
00:26:18,136 --> 00:26:21,765
Then the refrigerator's compressor
could have clicked on.

414
00:26:22,816 --> 00:26:24,807
(Marla) Yeah?

415
00:26:27,776 --> 00:26:29,767
(Marla) l can hear you breathing...

416
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,850
if you ask me now,
l couldn't tell you why l called him.

417
00:26:50,536 --> 00:26:52,527
(ringing tone)

418
00:27:02,616 --> 00:27:04,607
(engine starts)

419
00:27:11,056 --> 00:27:13,047
(phone rings)

420
00:27:23,336 --> 00:27:25,452
- Hello?
- (tyyler) Who's this?

421
00:27:25,536 --> 00:27:27,527
(tyyler munches)

422
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,607
- Tyler?
- Who is this?

423
00:27:29,696 --> 00:27:31,015
Um...

424
00:27:31,096 --> 00:27:33,212
We met... We met on the airplane.

425
00:27:33,296 --> 00:27:35,446
We had the same suitcase?

426
00:27:35,536 --> 00:27:37,527
Uh... the clever guy?

427
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:39,846
(laughs) Oh, yeah. Right.

428
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:44,336
l called a second ago. There was no answer.

429
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:48,409
- l'm at a payphone.
- Yeah, l *69'd you. l never pick up my phone.

430
00:27:51,096 --> 00:27:53,087
- So what's up?
- Uh...

431
00:27:53,736 --> 00:27:55,692
Well.

432
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,767
You're not gonna believe this.

433
00:27:59,816 --> 00:28:01,932
(tyyler) You know, it could be worse.

434
00:28:02,016 --> 00:28:05,611
A woman could cut off your penis
while you sleep and toss it out of a car.

435
00:28:06,456 --> 00:28:09,573
There's always that. l don't know.

436
00:28:09,656 --> 00:28:12,648
When you buy furniture,
you tell yourself, that's it.

437
00:28:12,736 --> 00:28:14,727
That's the last sofa l'll need.

438
00:28:14,816 --> 00:28:17,489
Whatever happens,
that sofa problem is handled.

439
00:28:17,576 --> 00:28:20,886
l had it all.
l had a stereo that was very decent.

440
00:28:20,976 --> 00:28:24,366
A wardrobe that was getting very respectable.

441
00:28:24,456 --> 00:28:26,526
l was close to being complete.

442
00:28:26,616 --> 00:28:29,050
- Shit, man. Now it's all gone.
- All gone.

443
00:28:29,136 --> 00:28:31,775
All gone.

444
00:28:32,976 --> 00:28:34,932
Do you know what a duvet is?

445
00:28:35,016 --> 00:28:37,769
- A comforter.
- lt's a blanket.

446
00:28:37,856 --> 00:28:41,690
Just a blanket. Why do guys
like you and l know what a duvet is?

447
00:28:41,776 --> 00:28:45,769
ls this essential to our survival
in the hunter-gatherer sense?

448
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:47,414
No.

449
00:28:47,496 --> 00:28:49,407
What are we, then?

450
00:28:49,496 --> 00:28:51,964
l dunno. Consumers.

451
00:28:52,056 --> 00:28:54,047
Right. We're consumers.

452
00:28:54,136 --> 00:28:57,287
We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession.

453
00:28:57,376 --> 00:29:01,130
Murder, crime, poverty.
These things don't concern me.

454
00:29:01,216 --> 00:29:04,492
What concerns me are celebrity magazines,...

455
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,567
..television with 500 channels,...

456
00:29:06,656 --> 00:29:09,216
..some guy's name on my underwear.
Rogaine.

457
00:29:09,296 --> 00:29:11,287
Viagra. Olestra.

458
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:14,095
- Martha Stewart.
- Fuck Martha Stewart.

459
00:29:14,176 --> 00:29:17,532
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.
lt's all going down.

460
00:29:17,616 --> 00:29:21,211
So fuck off with your sofa units
and Strinne green stripe patterns.

461
00:29:21,296 --> 00:29:24,447
l say never be complete.

462
00:29:24,536 --> 00:29:26,492
l say stop being perfect.

463
00:29:26,576 --> 00:29:28,532
l say let's evolve.

464
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:30,811
Let the chips fall where they may.

465
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,887
But that's me, and l could be wrong.

466
00:29:34,976 --> 00:29:36,967
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.

467
00:29:37,056 --> 00:29:39,445
lt's just stuff. Not a tragedy...

468
00:29:39,536 --> 00:29:43,131
You did lose a lot of versatile solutions
for modern living.

469
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:45,684
Fuck, you're right. l don't smoke.

470
00:29:48,936 --> 00:29:52,531
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...

471
00:29:54,896 --> 00:29:56,932
What?

472
00:29:57,016 --> 00:30:00,008
The things you own end up owning you.

473
00:30:03,216 --> 00:30:05,207
Do what you like, man.

474
00:30:05,896 --> 00:30:08,251
(sighs) Oh, it's late.

475
00:30:08,336 --> 00:30:10,930
- Hey, thanks for the beer.
- Yeah, man.

476
00:30:11,016 --> 00:30:13,007
l should find a hotel.

477
00:30:13,736 --> 00:30:15,727
- Oh!
- What?

478
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:17,374
What?

479
00:30:17,456 --> 00:30:19,447
- A hotel?
- Yeah.

480
00:30:19,536 --> 00:30:22,494
- Just ask, man.
- What are you talking about?

481
00:30:22,576 --> 00:30:26,171
Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer
and you still can't ask.

482
00:30:27,136 --> 00:30:28,694
What?

483
00:30:28,776 --> 00:30:31,336
You called me
because you needed a place to stay.

484
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:34,692
- Oh, hey. No, no, no.
- Yes, you did. So just ask.

485
00:30:34,776 --> 00:30:37,244
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.

486
00:30:38,976 --> 00:30:41,126
Would... Would that be a problem?

487
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:43,207
ls it a problem for you to ask?

488
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,326
- Can l stay at your place?
- Yeah.

489
00:30:47,656 --> 00:30:49,647
Thanks.

490
00:30:53,616 --> 00:30:56,494
- l want you to do me a favour.
- Yeah, sure.

491
00:30:56,576 --> 00:30:58,885
l want you to hit me as hard as you can.

492
00:30:58,976 --> 00:31:00,853
What?

493
00:31:00,936 --> 00:31:04,611
l want you to hit me as hard as you can.

494
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,494
Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.

495
00:31:07,736 --> 00:31:09,931
Tyler was a night person.

496
00:31:10,016 --> 00:31:12,166
While the rest of us slept, he worked.

497
00:31:12,256 --> 00:31:15,293
He had one part-time job as a projectionist.

498
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:18,254
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.
lt comes on a few.

499
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:21,885
Someone has to switch the projectors
at the exact moment...

500
00:31:21,976 --> 00:31:25,093
..that one reel ends and the next one begins.

501
00:31:25,176 --> 00:31:28,930
You can see little dots come into
the upper right corner of the screen.

502
00:31:29,016 --> 00:31:31,610
ln the industry, we call them cigarette burns.

503
00:31:31,696 --> 00:31:33,687
That's the cue for a changeover.

504
00:31:33,776 --> 00:31:38,327
He flips the projectors, movie keeps
going and the audience has no idea.

505
00:31:38,416 --> 00:31:40,566
Why would anyone want this shit job?

506
00:31:40,656 --> 00:31:43,693
Because it affords him
interesting opportunities.

507
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:47,166
Like splicing a frame of pornography
into family films.

508
00:31:47,256 --> 00:31:52,046
So when the snooty cat and the courageous
dog with the celebrity voices first meet,...

509
00:31:52,136 --> 00:31:56,175
..that's when you'll catch a flash
of Tyler's contribution to the film.

510
00:32:02,776 --> 00:32:05,290
Nobody knows that they saw it but they did.

511
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,810
Nice, big cock.

512
00:32:10,336 --> 00:32:12,327
(cries)

513
00:32:12,416 --> 00:32:15,089
Even a hummingbird
couldn't catch Tyler at work.

514
00:32:20,176 --> 00:32:25,011
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet
waiter at the luxurious Pressman hotel.

515
00:32:29,496 --> 00:32:33,375
He was the guerrilla terrorist
of the food service industry.

516
00:32:33,456 --> 00:32:35,651
Do not watch. l cannot go when you watch.

517
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:39,968
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,
he farted on meringues,...

518
00:32:40,056 --> 00:32:42,490
..and as for the cream of mushroom soup...

519
00:32:42,576 --> 00:32:44,532
(sniggers) Go ahead, tell 'em.

520
00:32:44,616 --> 00:32:46,527
You get the idea.

521
00:32:46,776 --> 00:32:49,813
- You just want me to hit you?
- Come on. Do me this one favour.

522
00:32:49,896 --> 00:32:53,127
- Why?
- l don't know. Never been in a fight. You?

523
00:32:53,216 --> 00:32:57,050
- No. But that's a good thing.
- You can't know yourself if you haven't!

524
00:32:57,136 --> 00:32:59,366
l don't wanna die without any scars.

525
00:32:59,456 --> 00:33:03,574
- Come on. Hit me, before l lose my nerve.
- Oh, God. This is crazy.

526
00:33:03,656 --> 00:33:05,851
So go crazy! Let it rip.

527
00:33:05,936 --> 00:33:08,496
- l don't know about this.
- l don't either.

528
00:33:08,576 --> 00:33:11,534
Who gives a shit? No-one's watching.
What do you care?

529
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:13,971
This is crazy. You want me to hit you?!

530
00:33:14,056 --> 00:33:16,047
That's right.

531
00:33:16,136 --> 00:33:19,208
- Where? Like, in the face?
- Surprise me.

532
00:33:21,296 --> 00:33:23,287
This is so fucking stupid.

533
00:33:33,736 --> 00:33:35,806
Motherfucker!

534
00:33:35,896 --> 00:33:37,887
He hit me in the ear!

535
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:41,048
- Well, Jesus, l'm sorry.
- Ow, Christ!

536
00:33:41,136 --> 00:33:43,127
- Why the ear, man?
- l fucked it up.

537
00:33:43,216 --> 00:33:44,854
No, that was perfect.

538
00:33:45,176 --> 00:33:47,167
Uh! Agh!

539
00:33:57,216 --> 00:33:59,252
(winded) No, it's all right.

540
00:34:00,056 --> 00:34:02,047
lt really hurts.

541
00:34:02,496 --> 00:34:04,487
Right.

542
00:34:04,816 --> 00:34:06,932
Hit me again.

543
00:34:07,016 --> 00:34:09,052
No, you hit me. Come on!

544
00:34:09,576 --> 00:34:11,567
(shouting)

545
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,685
We should do this again sometime.

546
00:34:39,976 --> 00:34:42,092
- Where's your car?
- What car?

547
00:34:42,176 --> 00:34:44,167
(belches)

548
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:54,451
l don't know how Tyler found that house...

549
00:34:54,536 --> 00:34:56,686
..but he said he'd been there for a year.

550
00:34:56,776 --> 00:34:59,529
lt looked like it was waiting to be torn down.

551
00:34:59,616 --> 00:35:01,925
Most of the windows were boarded up.

552
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:07,136
There was no lock on the front door from
when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.

553
00:35:07,216 --> 00:35:09,207
The stairs were ready to collapse.

554
00:35:09,296 --> 00:35:11,730
l didn't know ifhe owned it or was squatting.

555
00:35:11,816 --> 00:35:14,205
Neither would have surprised me.

556
00:35:15,056 --> 00:35:17,047
Yep. That's you.

557
00:35:17,136 --> 00:35:19,604
That's me. That's the toilet. Good?

558
00:35:19,696 --> 00:35:21,687
Yeah, thanks.

559
00:35:21,776 --> 00:35:23,607
What a shithole.

560
00:35:23,696 --> 00:35:25,573
Nothing worked.

561
00:35:29,056 --> 00:35:32,844
Turning on one light meant
another light in the house went out.

562
00:35:32,936 --> 00:35:36,531
There were no neighbours.
Just warehouses and a paper mill.

563
00:35:36,616 --> 00:35:40,450
That fart smell ofsteam.
The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.

564
00:35:42,136 --> 00:35:44,411
What have we here?

565
00:35:58,616 --> 00:36:00,652
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

566
00:36:11,176 --> 00:36:14,134
Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.

567
00:36:15,016 --> 00:36:18,213
By the end of the fiirst month,
l didn't miss TV.

568
00:36:19,216 --> 00:36:22,413
l didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.

569
00:36:34,336 --> 00:36:36,327
Can l be next?

570
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,567
All right, man.

571
00:36:42,656 --> 00:36:44,567
Lose the tie.

572
00:36:46,056 --> 00:36:48,524
- (glass smashing)
- (laughing)

573
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:52,609
At night, Tyler and l were alone
for haifa mile in every direction.

574
00:36:54,056 --> 00:36:55,614
(crash)

575
00:36:55,696 --> 00:36:57,766
(dogs barking)

576
00:36:57,856 --> 00:37:01,610
Rain trickled down through
the plaster and the light fiixtures.

577
00:37:01,696 --> 00:37:04,415
Everything wooden swelled and shrank.

578
00:37:04,496 --> 00:37:07,568
Everywhere were rusted nails
to snag your elbow on.

579
00:37:07,656 --> 00:37:10,124
The previous occupant had been a shut-in.

580
00:37:10,216 --> 00:37:12,207
Hey, man. What are you reading?

581
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:16,494
Listen to this. lt's an article written
by an organ in the first person.

582
00:37:16,576 --> 00:37:19,215
''l am Jack's medulla oblongata.
Without me,...

583
00:37:19,296 --> 00:37:22,606
..Jack could not regulate
his heart rate or breathing.''

584
00:37:22,696 --> 00:37:24,687
There's a whole series of these.

585
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:26,767
''l Am Jill's Nipples.''

586
00:37:28,696 --> 00:37:32,530
- ''l Am Jack's Colon.''
- (laughs) ''l Get Cancer. l Kill Jack.''

587
00:37:33,816 --> 00:37:35,568
Whoop! Agh!

588
00:37:35,656 --> 00:37:39,285
After fiighting, everything else
in life got the volume turned down.

589
00:37:39,376 --> 00:37:42,846
- (inaudible)
- What?

590
00:37:42,936 --> 00:37:46,326
- You could deal with anything.
- Have you finished those reports?

591
00:37:50,816 --> 00:37:53,284
(tyyler) ifyou could choose,
who would you fiight?

592
00:37:53,376 --> 00:37:55,367
l'd fight my boss, probably.

593
00:37:55,456 --> 00:37:57,492
Really?

594
00:37:57,576 --> 00:38:00,773
- Yeah, why? Who would you fight?
- l'd fight my dad.

595
00:38:00,856 --> 00:38:02,847
l don't know my dad.

596
00:38:02,936 --> 00:38:04,767
l mean, l know him, but...

597
00:38:04,856 --> 00:38:07,131
He left when l was like, six years old.

598
00:38:07,216 --> 00:38:10,094
Married this other woman
and had some other kids.

599
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,167
He did this every six years.

600
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:16,215
- He changes city and starts a new family.
- Fucker's setting up franchises!

601
00:38:17,016 --> 00:38:19,007
My dad never went to college.

602
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:22,850
- So it was real important that l go.
- That sounds familiar.

603
00:38:22,936 --> 00:38:27,214
So l graduate. Call him up long-distance
and say, ''Dad, now what?''

604
00:38:27,296 --> 00:38:29,207
- He says, ''Get a job.''
- Same here.

605
00:38:29,296 --> 00:38:31,856
Now l'm 25. Make my yearly call again.

606
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,847
''Dad, now what?''

607
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,972
He says, ''l dunno. Get married.''

608
00:38:36,056 --> 00:38:39,366
You can't get married.

609
00:38:40,096 --> 00:38:42,087
l'm a 30-year-old boy.

610
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,565
We're a generation of men raised by women.

611
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:48,729
l'm wondering if another woman
is really the answer we need.

612
00:38:54,496 --> 00:38:57,568
Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.

613
00:38:58,416 --> 00:39:01,726
But every Saturday night,
we were fiinding something out.

614
00:39:02,896 --> 00:39:06,206
We were fiinding out more and more
that we were not alone.

615
00:39:09,976 --> 00:39:14,447
lt used to be that when l came home angry
or depressed, l'djust clean my condo.

616
00:39:14,536 --> 00:39:16,527
Polish my Scandinavian furniture.

617
00:39:16,616 --> 00:39:21,451
l should have been looking for a new condo
or haggling with my insurance company.

618
00:39:21,536 --> 00:39:25,165
l should have been upset
about my nice flaming little shit.

619
00:39:25,256 --> 00:39:27,087
But l wasn't.

620
00:39:27,176 --> 00:39:30,691
The premise of cybernetting an office
is make things more efficient.

621
00:39:30,776 --> 00:39:33,495
Monday mornings,
ljust thought about next week.

622
00:39:33,576 --> 00:39:36,488
Can l get the icon in cornflower blue?

623
00:39:36,576 --> 00:39:37,645
Absolutely.

624
00:39:37,736 --> 00:39:40,853
Efficiency is priority No.1 , people.

625
00:39:40,976 --> 00:39:43,649
Because waste is a thief.

626
00:39:43,736 --> 00:39:46,728
l showed this to my man here.
You liked it, didn't you?

627
00:39:50,256 --> 00:39:54,010
You can swallow a pint ofblood
before you get sick.

628
00:39:55,016 --> 00:39:57,166
lt was right in everyone's face.

629
00:39:57,256 --> 00:39:59,326
Tyler and ljust made it visible.

630
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:01,725
lt was on the tip of everyone's tongue.

631
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,807
Tyler and ljust gave it a name.

632
00:40:03,896 --> 00:40:05,887
(rock music)

633
00:40:14,576 --> 00:40:16,567
Come on, you've gotta go home!

634
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:40,091
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.

635
00:41:00,176 --> 00:41:03,725
Every week,
Tyler gave the rules that he and l decided.

636
00:41:03,816 --> 00:41:05,807
Gentlemen!

637
00:41:06,536 --> 00:41:08,527
Welcome to Fight Club.

638
00:41:10,576 --> 00:41:12,646
The first rule of Fight Club is...

639
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:15,011
..you do not talk about Fight Club.

640
00:41:15,096 --> 00:41:17,564
The second rule of Fight Club is...

641
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:21,286
..you do not talk about Fight Club!

642
00:41:21,376 --> 00:41:23,571
Third rule of Fight Club.

643
00:41:23,656 --> 00:41:26,329
Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,...

644
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:29,055
..the fight is over. Fourth rule.

645
00:41:29,136 --> 00:41:31,366
Only two guys to a fight.

646
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:33,253
Fifth rule.

647
00:41:33,336 --> 00:41:35,896
- One fight at a time, fellas.
- (laughter)

648
00:41:35,976 --> 00:41:38,365
Sixth rule. No shirts. No shoes.

649
00:41:38,456 --> 00:41:42,210
Seventh rule.
Fights will go on as long as they have to.

650
00:41:43,976 --> 00:41:46,444
And the eighth and final rule.

651
00:41:47,536 --> 00:41:50,608
lf this is your first night at Fight Club...

652
00:41:50,696 --> 00:41:52,687
..you have to fight.

653
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:54,767
(shouting and cheering)

654
00:41:56,576 --> 00:41:58,567
This kid from work, Ricky,...

655
00:41:58,656 --> 00:42:02,968
..couldn't remember whether
you ordered pens with blue ink or black.

656
00:42:03,056 --> 00:42:05,365
But Ricky was a god for ten minutes...

657
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:08,653
..when he trounced
the maitre d' ofa local food court.

658
00:42:10,456 --> 00:42:15,576
Sometimes, all you could hear were
the flat, hard, packing sounds over the yelling.

659
00:42:19,176 --> 00:42:22,088
Or the wet choke
when someone gasped and sprayed...

660
00:42:22,176 --> 00:42:24,132
Stop!

661
00:42:24,216 --> 00:42:26,969
You weren't alive anywhere
like you were there.

662
00:42:27,056 --> 00:42:31,652
But Fight Club only exists in the hours
between when Fight Club starts and ends.

663
00:42:32,176 --> 00:42:35,088
Even ifl could tell someone
they had a good fiight,...

664
00:42:35,176 --> 00:42:37,371
..l wouldn't be talking to the same man.

665
00:42:37,456 --> 00:42:40,653
Who you were in Fight Club
is not who you were outside ofit.

666
00:42:40,736 --> 00:42:45,571
A guy came to Fight Club for the fiirst time.
His ass was a wad of cookie dough.

667
00:42:45,656 --> 00:42:48,375
After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.

668
00:42:49,176 --> 00:42:52,248
lf you could fight any celebrity,
who would you fight?

669
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:55,328
- Alive or dead?
- Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?

670
00:42:56,216 --> 00:42:59,208
Hemingway. You?

671
00:42:59,816 --> 00:43:02,853
Shatner. l'd fight William Shatner.

672
00:43:03,856 --> 00:43:06,928
We all started seeing things differently.

673
00:43:08,136 --> 00:43:11,367
Everywhere we went,
we were sizing things up.

674
00:43:14,576 --> 00:43:17,568
l felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,...

675
00:43:17,656 --> 00:43:21,569
..trying to look like how Calvin Klein
or Tommy Hilfiiger said they should.

676
00:43:21,656 --> 00:43:23,692
ls that what a man looks like?

677
00:43:24,576 --> 00:43:27,295
Oh, self-improvement is masturbation.

678
00:43:27,376 --> 00:43:29,367
Now, self-destruction...

679
00:43:29,456 --> 00:43:31,367
Excuse me.

680
00:43:31,456 --> 00:43:33,208
(man roars)

681
00:43:33,296 --> 00:43:35,287
(cheering)

682
00:43:57,096 --> 00:43:59,087
(cheering)

683
00:44:04,576 --> 00:44:07,648
Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.

684
00:44:07,736 --> 00:44:09,727
lt wasn't about words.

685
00:44:11,576 --> 00:44:14,932
The hysterical shouting was in tongues...

686
00:44:15,016 --> 00:44:16,893
..like at a Pentecostal Church.

687
00:44:21,256 --> 00:44:23,247
- ls that it?
- Stop!

688
00:44:23,336 --> 00:44:26,089
When the fiight was over, nothing was solved.

689
00:44:26,176 --> 00:44:28,007
But nothing mattered.

690
00:44:28,096 --> 00:44:30,769
Cool.

691
00:44:30,856 --> 00:44:33,529
Afterwards, we all felt saved.

692
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:36,611
Hey, man. How about next week?

693
00:44:36,696 --> 00:44:38,687
How about next month?!

694
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:40,767
Everybody here in the middle.

695
00:44:40,856 --> 00:44:42,812
New guy, you too.

696
00:44:44,496 --> 00:44:46,566
Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.

697
00:44:46,656 --> 00:44:48,647
He fell down some stairs.

698
00:44:49,296 --> 00:44:51,287
l fell down some stairs.

699
00:44:53,056 --> 00:44:57,527
Fight Club became the reason to cut
your hair short or trim your fiingernails.

700
00:44:57,616 --> 00:45:00,005
OK. Any historical figure.

701
00:45:00,096 --> 00:45:01,893
l'd fight Gandhi.

702
00:45:02,496 --> 00:45:04,248
Good answer.

703
00:45:04,336 --> 00:45:06,486
- How about you?
- Lincoln.

704
00:45:06,576 --> 00:45:09,044
Lincoln? Hmm.

705
00:45:09,136 --> 00:45:12,606
Big guy, big reach.
Skinny guys fight till they're burger.

706
00:45:13,456 --> 00:45:15,447
Fuck!

707
00:45:16,576 --> 00:45:19,170
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.

708
00:45:22,976 --> 00:45:24,853
(phone rings)

709
00:45:27,896 --> 00:45:29,215
Hello?

710
00:45:29,296 --> 00:45:31,605
Where have you been the last eight weeks?

711
00:45:31,696 --> 00:45:32,924
Marla?

712
00:45:33,016 --> 00:45:35,007
(tyyler yells)

713
00:45:35,776 --> 00:45:38,813
- How did you find me?
- You left a forwarding number.

714
00:45:38,896 --> 00:45:41,774
l haven't seen you at any support groups.

715
00:45:41,856 --> 00:45:44,928
We split 'em up.
That was the idea. Remember?

716
00:45:45,016 --> 00:45:47,735
Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.

717
00:45:47,816 --> 00:45:51,172
- How do you know?
- l cheated.

718
00:45:51,256 --> 00:45:53,008
l found a new one.

719
00:45:53,536 --> 00:45:55,731
- Really?
- lt's for men only.

720
00:45:55,816 --> 00:45:57,329
Like the testicle thing?

721
00:45:57,416 --> 00:45:59,407
(tyyler) Whah!

722
00:46:00,936 --> 00:46:02,892
Look, this is a bad time.

723
00:46:02,976 --> 00:46:05,331
l've been going to Debtors Anonymous.

724
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:08,806
- They're really fucked-up people...
- l'm on my way out.

725
00:46:08,896 --> 00:46:11,171
Me too. l've got a stomach full of Xanax.

726
00:46:11,256 --> 00:46:13,451
l took what was left of a bottle.

727
00:46:13,536 --> 00:46:15,527
lt might have been too much.

728
00:46:15,616 --> 00:46:19,086
Picture Marla Singer throw herseif
around her crummy apartment.

729
00:46:19,216 --> 00:46:23,528
This isn't a for-real suicide thing.
This is probably a cry-for-help thing.

730
00:46:23,616 --> 00:46:26,414
So you're staying in tonight, then?

731
00:46:26,496 --> 00:46:29,215
Do you wanna wait
and hear me describe death?

732
00:46:29,296 --> 00:46:33,608
Do you wanna listen
and see ifmy spirit can use a phone?

733
00:46:35,776 --> 00:46:38,336
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?

734
00:47:03,536 --> 00:47:08,166
Tyler's door was closed. l'd been here for
two months and his door was never closed.

735
00:47:10,176 --> 00:47:12,167
(footsteps)

736
00:47:12,976 --> 00:47:15,934
You won't believe this dream
l had last night.

737
00:47:16,016 --> 00:47:19,167
l can hardly believe anything about last night.

738
00:47:24,456 --> 00:47:26,447
(gargles)

739
00:47:26,936 --> 00:47:28,494
(giggles)

740
00:47:28,576 --> 00:47:30,453
What are you doing here?

741
00:47:33,056 --> 00:47:35,047
What?

742
00:47:35,136 --> 00:47:37,491
This is my house.
What are you doing here?

743
00:47:39,776 --> 00:47:41,687
Fuck you!

744
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,573
(drops glass)

745
00:47:54,096 --> 00:47:55,654
(tyyler laughs)

746
00:47:55,736 --> 00:47:58,933
Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!

747
00:47:59,016 --> 00:48:00,927
Limber, though.

748
00:48:01,016 --> 00:48:02,927
Silly cooze.

749
00:48:03,976 --> 00:48:06,570
l come in last night. Phone's off the hook.

750
00:48:06,656 --> 00:48:08,647
Guess who's on the other end?

751
00:48:08,736 --> 00:48:10,852
l knew the story before he told me.

752
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:16,492
(Marla)
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?

753
00:48:16,576 --> 00:48:19,295
Do you think it'll live up to its name?

754
00:48:19,376 --> 00:48:22,812
Or will itjust be a death hairball?

755
00:48:23,296 --> 00:48:25,287
(coughs)

756
00:48:26,096 --> 00:48:29,930
Prepare to evacuate soul.

757
00:48:30,016 --> 00:48:31,574
(Marla) Ten,...

758
00:48:31,656 --> 00:48:34,329
..nine,... eight,...

759
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:36,566
How could Tyler, ofall people,...

760
00:48:36,656 --> 00:48:40,365
..think it was a bad thing
that Marla Singer was about to die?

761
00:48:40,456 --> 00:48:42,014
..fiive,...

762
00:48:42,096 --> 00:48:43,654
..four...

763
00:48:44,376 --> 00:48:46,367
Hang on.

764
00:48:51,576 --> 00:48:53,806
You got here fast.

765
00:48:55,296 --> 00:48:57,287
Did l call you?

766
00:48:58,376 --> 00:48:59,968
Huh?

767
00:49:07,576 --> 00:49:10,568
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic.

768
00:49:13,656 --> 00:49:15,965
Oh, don't worry. lt's not a threat to you.

769
00:49:16,816 --> 00:49:18,568
(approaching sirens)

770
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:20,453
Oh, fuck!

771
00:49:20,536 --> 00:49:22,527
Somebody called the cops.

772
00:49:29,176 --> 00:49:30,973
(shouting)

773
00:49:33,976 --> 00:49:37,332
- Hey, where's 513?
- End of the hall.

774
00:49:38,096 --> 00:49:41,805
The girl who lives there
used to be a charming, lovely girl.

775
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:43,966
She has lost faith in herself.

776
00:49:44,056 --> 00:49:46,775
- Miss Singer, let us help you!
- She's a monster!

777
00:49:46,856 --> 00:49:50,815
- You have every reason to live.
- She's infectious human waste!

778
00:49:50,896 --> 00:49:54,525
- (cop) Miss Singer!
- Good luck trying to save her!

779
00:49:59,136 --> 00:50:01,252
lf l fall asleep,...

780
00:50:01,336 --> 00:50:03,486
..l'm done for.

781
00:50:05,376 --> 00:50:07,492
You're gonna have to keep me up...

782
00:50:07,576 --> 00:50:09,567
..all night.

783
00:50:09,656 --> 00:50:11,886
Un-fucking-believable.

784
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:14,046
He was obviously able to handle it.

785
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:17,685
- You know what l mean, you fucked her.
- No, l didn't.

786
00:50:17,776 --> 00:50:19,767
- Never?
- No.

787
00:50:20,696 --> 00:50:22,687
You're not into her, are you?

788
00:50:22,776 --> 00:50:24,767
No! God, not at all.

789
00:50:24,856 --> 00:50:27,370
l am Jack's raging bile duct.

790
00:50:27,456 --> 00:50:29,333
Are you sure? You can tell me.

791
00:50:29,416 --> 00:50:31,213
Believe me, l'm sure.

792
00:50:31,296 --> 00:50:34,447
- Put a gun to my head and spray my brains.
- That's good.

793
00:50:34,536 --> 00:50:37,175
She's a predator posing as a house pet.
Stay away.

794
00:50:39,056 --> 00:50:42,571
The shit that came out of
this woman's mouth, l had never heard!

795
00:50:42,656 --> 00:50:44,248
My God.

796
00:50:44,336 --> 00:50:47,567
l haven't been fucked like that
since grade school.

797
00:50:47,656 --> 00:50:50,011
- Euch!
- How could Tyler not go for that?

798
00:50:50,096 --> 00:50:53,486
The other night,
he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.

799
00:50:53,576 --> 00:50:56,249
Marla doesn't need a lover,
just a caseworker.

800
00:50:56,336 --> 00:50:58,850
Or a wash.
This isn't love, it's sport fucking.

801
00:50:58,936 --> 00:51:01,689
She invaded my support groups
and now my home.

802
00:51:01,776 --> 00:51:03,767
Hey, hey. Sit down.

803
00:51:07,696 --> 00:51:10,972
Now, listen.
l can't have you talking to her about me.

804
00:51:11,056 --> 00:51:12,808
Why would l...

805
00:51:12,896 --> 00:51:18,050
Say anything about me or what goes on
in this house to her or anybody,... we're done.

806
00:51:18,136 --> 00:51:20,696
- Now promise me. You promise?
- OK.

807
00:51:20,776 --> 00:51:22,812
- Yeah, l promise.
- Promise?

808
00:51:22,896 --> 00:51:26,127
- l just said, l promise! What...
- That's three times you promised.

809
00:51:27,576 --> 00:51:31,410
if only l had wasted a few minutes
and gone to watch Marla Singer die,...

810
00:51:31,496 --> 00:51:33,487
..none of this would have happened.

811
00:51:33,576 --> 00:51:35,567
(Marla groans)

812
00:51:36,416 --> 00:51:38,134
(thudding)

813
00:51:38,216 --> 00:51:41,014
(Marla) Harder, yes! Oh, harder, harder!

814
00:51:41,736 --> 00:51:43,727
(Marla squeals)

815
00:51:45,256 --> 00:51:47,247
(thudding)

816
00:51:47,336 --> 00:51:49,725
l could have moved to another room.

817
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:54,491
On the third floor
where l might not have heard them.

818
00:51:54,576 --> 00:51:56,567
But l didn't.

819
00:52:00,416 --> 00:52:02,407
(Marla moans)

820
00:52:08,256 --> 00:52:11,248
(ecstatic moaning)

821
00:52:12,976 --> 00:52:14,967
(rumbling)

822
00:52:15,496 --> 00:52:16,895
(tyyler) Ow!

823
00:52:19,776 --> 00:52:23,735
- What are you doing?
- Just going to bed.

824
00:52:23,816 --> 00:52:25,807
Wanna finish her off?

825
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:27,693
(Marla) Ooh!

826
00:52:28,576 --> 00:52:32,012
- No. No, thank you.
- (Marla) l've found a cigarette.

827
00:52:32,096 --> 00:52:35,293
- Who were you talking to?
- Shut up.

828
00:52:35,376 --> 00:52:38,527
l became the calm little centre of the world.

829
00:52:39,136 --> 00:52:41,127
l was the Zen master.

830
00:52:46,056 --> 00:52:47,967
l wrote little haiku poems.

831
00:52:48,576 --> 00:52:50,806
l e-mailed them to everyone.

832
00:52:50,896 --> 00:52:52,932
ls that your blood?

833
00:52:54,536 --> 00:52:56,527
Some of it, yeah.

834
00:52:56,616 --> 00:52:59,176
You can't smoke in here.

835
00:52:59,256 --> 00:53:01,247
Take the rest of the day off.

836
00:53:01,336 --> 00:53:03,770
Come back Monday with some clean clothes.

837
00:53:03,856 --> 00:53:05,847
Get yourself together.

838
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:08,491
l got right in everyone's hostile face.

839
00:53:08,576 --> 00:53:10,965
''Yes, these are bruises from fiighting. ''

840
00:53:11,056 --> 00:53:13,047
''Yes, l'm comfortable with that. ''

841
00:53:13,136 --> 00:53:14,933
''l am enlightened. ''

842
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:21,725
You give up the condo life, give up
all your flaming worldly possessions,...

843
00:53:21,816 --> 00:53:24,774
..move to a dilapidated house
in a toxic waste area,...

844
00:53:24,856 --> 00:53:28,565
- ..and you have to come home to this.
- (shouting and thudding)

845
00:53:28,656 --> 00:53:30,567
(phone rings)

846
00:53:30,656 --> 00:53:34,171
(tyyler and Marla squeal)

847
00:53:38,776 --> 00:53:42,052
- Hello.
- This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.

848
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:46,175
We have some new information about
the incident at your former condo.

849
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:47,484
Yes.

850
00:53:47,576 --> 00:53:52,286
l don't know if you're aware, but someone
sprayed Freon into your front-door lock.

851
00:53:52,376 --> 00:53:54,936
They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.

852
00:53:55,016 --> 00:53:56,927
No, l wasn't aware of that.

853
00:53:57,016 --> 00:53:58,927
(thinks) l am Jack's cold sweat.

854
00:53:59,016 --> 00:54:01,211
Does this sound strange to you?

855
00:54:01,296 --> 00:54:04,015
Yes, sir, strange. Very strange.

856
00:54:04,096 --> 00:54:06,052
- The dynamite...
- Dynamite?

857
00:54:06,136 --> 00:54:09,128
..left a residue
of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.

858
00:54:09,216 --> 00:54:12,526
- Do you know what this means?
- No, what does it mean?

859
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:14,447
lt means it was home-made.

860
00:54:14,536 --> 00:54:18,609
l'm sorry. This is just coming
as quite a shock to me, sir.

861
00:54:18,696 --> 00:54:24,009
Whoever set this dynamite could have blown
out your pilot light days before the explosion.

862
00:54:24,096 --> 00:54:27,054
- The gas wasjust a detonator.
- Who would go and do that?

863
00:54:27,136 --> 00:54:29,127
- l'll ask the questions.
- Tell him.

864
00:54:29,256 --> 00:54:33,454
Tell him the liberator who destroyed
my property realigned my perceptions.

865
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:35,527
Excuse me. Are you there?

866
00:54:35,616 --> 00:54:38,414
l am listening.
lt's hard to know what to make of this.

867
00:54:38,496 --> 00:54:42,774
Have you recently made enemies who might
have access to home-made dynamite?

868
00:54:42,856 --> 00:54:45,051
- Enemies?
- Reject civilisation,...

869
00:54:45,136 --> 00:54:47,127
..especially material possessions.

870
00:54:47,216 --> 00:54:49,969
- Son, this is serious.
- Yes, l know it's serious.

871
00:54:50,056 --> 00:54:52,524
- l mean that.
- Yes, it's very serious.

872
00:54:52,616 --> 00:54:55,335
Look, nobody takes this
more seriously than me.

873
00:54:55,416 --> 00:54:58,055
That condo was my life. OK?

874
00:54:58,136 --> 00:55:01,526
l loved every stick of furniture in that place.

875
00:55:01,616 --> 00:55:04,528
That was notjust a bunch ofstuff
that got destroyed.

876
00:55:04,616 --> 00:55:07,369
- lt was me!
- (thinks) l'd like to thank the Academy.

877
00:55:07,456 --> 00:55:11,335
- ls this not a good time for you?
- Just tell him you fucking did it!

878
00:55:11,416 --> 00:55:15,125
Tell him you blew it all up!
That's what he wants to hear.

879
00:55:15,216 --> 00:55:19,892
- Are you still there?
- Wait. Are you saying that l'm a suspect?

880
00:55:19,976 --> 00:55:23,810
No. l may need to talk to you, so you
let me know if you're gonna leave town.

881
00:55:23,896 --> 00:55:26,171
- OK?
- OK.

882
00:55:28,776 --> 00:55:33,213
Except for their humping,
Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.

883
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:36,254
My parents pulled this exact same act
for years.

884
00:55:36,336 --> 00:55:39,931
The condom is the glass slipper
of our generation.

885
00:55:40,016 --> 00:55:42,814
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.

886
00:55:42,896 --> 00:55:44,887
You... dance all night.

887
00:55:44,976 --> 00:55:46,967
Then you throw it away.

888
00:55:47,176 --> 00:55:49,736
The condom, l mean. Not the stranger.

889
00:55:51,176 --> 00:55:52,609
What?

890
00:55:57,256 --> 00:55:59,929
l got this dress at a thrift store for $1 .

891
00:56:00,016 --> 00:56:01,813
lt was worth every penny.

892
00:56:01,896 --> 00:56:03,887
lt's a bridesmaid's dress.

893
00:56:04,816 --> 00:56:07,888
Someone loved it intensely...

894
00:56:07,976 --> 00:56:09,932
..for one day.

895
00:56:10,016 --> 00:56:12,007
Then tossed it.

896
00:56:13,816 --> 00:56:15,807
Like a Christmas tree.

897
00:56:15,896 --> 00:56:17,932
So special.

898
00:56:18,016 --> 00:56:19,415
Then...

899
00:56:19,496 --> 00:56:21,214
..bam!

900
00:56:21,296 --> 00:56:23,287
lt's on the side of the road.

901
00:56:23,816 --> 00:56:25,852
Tinsel still clinging to it.

902
00:56:27,816 --> 00:56:29,807
Like a sex crime victim.

903
00:56:29,896 --> 00:56:31,887
Underwear inside out.

904
00:56:32,536 --> 00:56:36,211
- Bound with electrical tape.
- Well then, it suits you.

905
00:56:36,296 --> 00:56:38,890
You can borrow it sometime.

906
00:56:45,616 --> 00:56:47,607
Get rid of her.

907
00:56:48,376 --> 00:56:51,174
- What? You get rid of her!
- Don't mention me.

908
00:56:51,256 --> 00:56:55,249
l am six years old again,
passing messages between parents.

909
00:56:57,176 --> 00:57:00,646
- l really think it's time you left.
- Don't worry, l'm leaving.

910
00:57:00,736 --> 00:57:05,173
- Not that we don't love your visits.
- You are such a nutcase. l can't keep up.

911
00:57:07,256 --> 00:57:10,009
(note) Gotta get off

912
00:57:10,096 --> 00:57:11,324
Thanks. Bye.

913
00:57:11,416 --> 00:57:17,127
(note) Gotta get off of this merry-go-round

914
00:57:17,856 --> 00:57:21,531
(note) Gonna get, need to get...

915
00:57:21,616 --> 00:57:23,572
(note) Gotta get...

916
00:57:23,656 --> 00:57:25,612
(sniggers)

917
00:57:25,696 --> 00:57:27,049
You kids!

918
00:57:28,976 --> 00:57:31,365
Why do you still waste time with her?

919
00:57:31,456 --> 00:57:33,651
l'll say this about Marla.

920
00:57:33,736 --> 00:57:35,931
At least she's trying to hit bottom.

921
00:57:36,016 --> 00:57:37,290
And l'm not?

922
00:57:37,376 --> 00:57:40,095
Feathers up your butt
do not make you a chicken.

923
00:57:40,176 --> 00:57:42,167
What are we doing tonight?

924
00:57:42,816 --> 00:57:44,966
Tonight... we make soap.

925
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:46,931
Really?

926
00:57:47,016 --> 00:57:49,849
To make soap, first we render fat.

927
00:58:07,936 --> 00:58:10,006
The salt balance has to be just right...

928
00:58:10,096 --> 00:58:12,530
..so the best fat for soap comes from humans.

929
00:58:13,296 --> 00:58:16,254
- Wait, what is this place?
- A liposuction clinic.

930
00:58:24,096 --> 00:58:26,052
Pay dirt!

931
00:58:26,136 --> 00:58:29,811
Richest, creamiest fat in the world.
Fat of the land!

932
00:58:35,176 --> 00:58:38,612
No! Don't pull it, don't pull it!

933
00:58:43,016 --> 00:58:45,211
- Oh, God!
- Give me another one.

934
00:58:51,096 --> 00:58:54,406
(tyyler) As the fat renders,
the tallows float to the surface.

935
00:58:54,496 --> 00:58:56,487
Like in Boy Scouts.

936
00:58:56,576 --> 00:59:00,205
- lt's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.
- Keep stirring.

937
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:05,846
Once the tallow hardens,
you skim off a layer of glycerin.

938
00:59:05,936 --> 00:59:08,245
Add nitric acid, you've got nitroglycerin.

939
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:12,011
Then add sodium nitrate and sawdust,
you've got dynamite.

940
00:59:12,096 --> 00:59:15,771
Yeah, with enough soap,
one could blow up just about anything.

941
00:59:15,856 --> 00:59:17,847
Tyler was full of useful information.

942
00:59:17,936 --> 00:59:21,724
People found clothes got cleaner
when washed at a certain point in the river.

943
00:59:21,816 --> 00:59:23,807
- You know why?
- No.

944
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:30,125
Human sacrifices were once made
on the hills above this river.

945
00:59:30,216 --> 00:59:33,288
Bodies burnt.
Water permeated the ashes to create lye.

946
00:59:33,376 --> 00:59:35,685
This is lye. The crucial ingredient.

947
00:59:35,776 --> 00:59:40,372
Once it mixed with the melted body fat,
a white soapy discharge crept into the river.

948
00:59:40,456 --> 00:59:42,447
May l see your hand, please?

949
00:59:47,616 --> 00:59:50,733
- (kisses)
- What is this?

950
00:59:50,816 --> 00:59:53,284
- This is a chemical burn.
- Agh! Aaagh!

951
00:59:53,376 --> 00:59:56,732
lt will hurt more than any burn
and it will leave a scar.

952
00:59:56,816 --> 00:59:59,376
Meditation worked for cancer,
it could work now.

953
01:00:00,136 --> 01:00:02,775
- Don't shut the pain out.
- Oh, God!

954
01:00:03,536 --> 01:00:07,814
The first soap was made from heroes' ashes,
like the first monkey shot into space.

955
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:10,774
Without pain or sacrifice,
we would have nothing.

956
01:00:10,856 --> 01:00:13,654
l tried not to think
of the word searing offlesh.

957
01:00:13,736 --> 01:00:16,773
Stop it!
This is your pain, this is your burning hand.

958
01:00:16,856 --> 01:00:19,416
l'm going to my cave
to find my power animal.

959
01:00:19,496 --> 01:00:23,375
No! Don't deal with this
the way those dead people do! Come on!

960
01:00:23,456 --> 01:00:27,290
- l get the point!
- No! You're feeling premature enlightenment.

961
01:00:29,976 --> 01:00:33,889
lt's the greatest moment of your life,
and you're off somewhere else!

962
01:00:33,976 --> 01:00:35,409
l am not!

963
01:00:35,496 --> 01:00:38,374
Shut up!
Our fathers were our models for God.

964
01:00:38,456 --> 01:00:41,493
lf our fathers bailed,
what does that tell you about God?

965
01:00:42,456 --> 01:00:47,484
Listen to me. You have to consider
the possibility that God does not like you.

966
01:00:47,576 --> 01:00:51,489
He never wanted you.
ln all probability, He hates you.

967
01:00:51,576 --> 01:00:55,012
This is not the worst thing that can happen.
We don't need Him!

968
01:00:55,096 --> 01:00:57,929
- l agree!
- Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.

969
01:00:58,016 --> 01:01:00,405
We are God's unwanted children? So be it!

970
01:01:00,496 --> 01:01:04,808
- l'm getting water!
- You can use water and make it worse or...

971
01:01:05,896 --> 01:01:09,286
- Or use vinegar to neutralise the burn.
- Please let me up!

972
01:01:09,376 --> 01:01:11,367
First, you have to give up.

973
01:01:11,456 --> 01:01:14,050
First, you have to know, not fear,...

974
01:01:14,136 --> 01:01:17,014
..know that some day, you're gonna die.

975
01:01:17,096 --> 01:01:19,212
You don't know how this feels!

976
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:27,134
lt's only after we've lost everything
that we're free to do anything.

977
01:01:29,056 --> 01:01:31,047
OK. (whimpers)

978
01:01:43,776 --> 01:01:45,732
Congratulations.

979
01:01:45,816 --> 01:01:48,614
You're one step closer to hitting the bottom.

980
01:01:51,536 --> 01:01:54,448
Tyler sold his soap
to department stores at $20 a bar.

981
01:01:54,536 --> 01:01:56,447
God knows what they charged.

982
01:01:56,536 --> 01:01:59,608
- This is the best soap.
- Why, thank you, Susan.

983
01:01:59,696 --> 01:02:01,687
lt was beautiful.

984
01:02:01,776 --> 01:02:05,485
We were selling rich women
their own fat asses back to them.

985
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:08,447
He was wearing his yellow tie.

986
01:02:08,536 --> 01:02:10,731
l didn't wear a tie to work any more.

987
01:02:10,816 --> 01:02:14,286
''The first rule of Fight Club
is don't talk about Fight Club.''

988
01:02:14,376 --> 01:02:17,766
l'm haif-asleep again.
l must have left it in the copy machine.

989
01:02:17,856 --> 01:02:20,245
''The second rule...'' ls this yours?

990
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:21,974
Huh?

991
01:02:22,056 --> 01:02:25,446
Pretend you're me.
Make a managerial decision.

992
01:02:25,536 --> 01:02:27,891
You find this. What would you do?

993
01:02:32,336 --> 01:02:34,247
Well, l gotta tell you,...

994
01:02:34,336 --> 01:02:37,851
..l'd be very, very careful
who you talk to about that.

995
01:02:37,936 --> 01:02:41,087
Because the person who wrote that
is dangerous.

996
01:02:41,176 --> 01:02:45,488
And this button-down, Oxford-cloth psycho
might just snap...

997
01:02:45,576 --> 01:02:48,329
..and then stalk from office to office...

998
01:02:48,416 --> 01:02:53,251
..with an Armalite AR10 carbine gas-powered
semiautomatic weapon,...

999
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:57,614
..pumping round after round
into colleagues and co-workers.

1000
01:02:58,256 --> 01:03:01,487
This might be someone
you've known for years.

1001
01:03:01,576 --> 01:03:04,568
Someone very, very close to you.

1002
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:07,887
Tyler's words coming out ofmy mouth.

1003
01:03:08,856 --> 01:03:10,847
And l used to be such a nice guy.

1004
01:03:10,936 --> 01:03:14,133
Or maybe you shouldn't bring me
every piece of trash you pick up.

1005
01:03:14,216 --> 01:03:15,854
(phone rings)

1006
01:03:17,816 --> 01:03:21,331
- Compliance and Liability.
- My tit's gonna rot off.

1007
01:03:22,216 --> 01:03:24,684
Will you excuse me? l need to take this.

1008
01:03:30,696 --> 01:03:34,211
- What do you mean?
- l need you to check for a lump in my breast.

1009
01:03:34,296 --> 01:03:38,084
- Go to a hospital.
- l can't afford to waste money on a doctor.

1010
01:03:39,016 --> 01:03:41,132
l don't know about this, Marla.

1011
01:03:41,216 --> 01:03:42,854
Please.

1012
01:03:42,936 --> 01:03:46,770
She didn't call Tyler. l'm neutral in her book.

1013
01:03:48,736 --> 01:03:52,615
That's nice.
Taking food to Mrs Haniver and Mrs Raines.

1014
01:03:52,696 --> 01:03:54,687
Where are they, exactly?

1015
01:03:54,776 --> 01:03:58,735
Tragically, they're dead.
l'm alive and l'm in poverty. Want any?

1016
01:03:58,816 --> 01:04:00,807
- No, no.
- l got one for you.

1017
01:04:00,896 --> 01:04:02,887
Thanks for the thought.

1018
01:04:04,216 --> 01:04:06,411
What happened to your hand?

1019
01:04:06,496 --> 01:04:08,566
Oh, nothing.

1020
01:04:08,656 --> 01:04:10,647
- Right there?
- Mm.

1021
01:04:11,656 --> 01:04:14,216
- Feel anything?
- No.

1022
01:04:14,336 --> 01:04:16,247
Well, make sure.

1023
01:04:16,336 --> 01:04:18,292
OK, l'm pretty sure.

1024
01:04:18,376 --> 01:04:20,287
You feel nothing?

1025
01:04:20,376 --> 01:04:22,571
No, nothing.

1026
01:04:24,056 --> 01:04:26,775
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.

1027
01:04:28,296 --> 01:04:31,368
- No problem.
- l wish l could return the favour.

1028
01:04:31,456 --> 01:04:33,447
Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.

1029
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,892
- l could check your prostate.
- l think l'm OK.

1030
01:04:36,976 --> 01:04:38,967
Well, thanks, anyway.

1031
01:04:43,776 --> 01:04:46,006
- Are we done?
- Yeah, we're done.

1032
01:04:46,096 --> 01:04:48,212
See you... around.

1033
01:05:04,758 --> 01:05:06,749
(man) Cornelius?

1034
01:05:06,838 --> 01:05:09,113
Cornelius!

1035
01:05:09,198 --> 01:05:11,792
lt's me! Bob!

1036
01:05:11,878 --> 01:05:13,277
Hey, Bob.

1037
01:05:16,678 --> 01:05:19,556
- We all thought you were dead.
- No, no. Still here.

1038
01:05:19,638 --> 01:05:23,517
- How are you, Bob?
- Better than l've ever been in my whole life.

1039
01:05:23,598 --> 01:05:26,954
- Really? Still remaining men together?
- No, no.

1040
01:05:27,038 --> 01:05:30,667
- l got something so much better now.
- Really, what is it?

1041
01:05:31,278 --> 01:05:33,075
Well...

1042
01:05:33,158 --> 01:05:37,231
The first rule is,
l'm not supposed to talk about it.

1043
01:05:37,358 --> 01:05:39,349
And the second rule is...

1044
01:05:39,438 --> 01:05:41,633
..l'm not supposed to talk about it.

1045
01:05:41,718 --> 01:05:45,028
- And the third rule is...
- Bob, Bob. l'm a member.

1046
01:05:45,118 --> 01:05:47,109
Look at my face, Bob.

1047
01:05:49,438 --> 01:05:51,668
That's fucking... fucking great.

1048
01:05:51,758 --> 01:05:55,307
- l've never seen you there.
- l go Tuesdays and Thursdays.

1049
01:05:55,398 --> 01:05:58,947
- l go Saturday.
- Congratulations.

1050
01:05:59,358 --> 01:06:01,588
Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?

1051
01:06:01,678 --> 01:06:04,238
Have you heard about the guy
that invented it?

1052
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:07,116
- Yeah, actually...
- l hear all kinds of things.

1053
01:06:07,198 --> 01:06:10,668
Supposedly,
he was born in a mental institution...

1054
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:13,989
..and he sleeps only one hour a night.

1055
01:06:14,078 --> 01:06:16,194
He's a great man.

1056
01:06:17,638 --> 01:06:19,833
Do you know about Tyler Durden?

1057
01:06:21,758 --> 01:06:23,828
(cheering)

1058
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:41,669
(cheering)

1059
01:06:43,798 --> 01:06:45,789
l didn't hurt you, did l?

1060
01:06:45,878 --> 01:06:47,869
Actually, you did.

1061
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:49,949
Thank you for this.

1062
01:06:50,198 --> 01:06:52,473
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1063
01:06:52,558 --> 01:06:54,549
Fight Club.

1064
01:06:54,638 --> 01:06:56,674
This was mine and Tyler's gift.

1065
01:06:56,878 --> 01:06:58,755
Our gift to the world.

1066
01:06:58,838 --> 01:07:02,035
l look around, l look around,
l see a lot of new faces.

1067
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:03,517
(laughing)

1068
01:07:03,598 --> 01:07:05,714
Shut up!

1069
01:07:05,798 --> 01:07:10,474
Which means a lot of people have been
breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.

1070
01:07:18,438 --> 01:07:22,351
l see in Fight Club the strongest
and smartest men who've ever lived.

1071
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:24,429
l see all this potential.

1072
01:07:24,518 --> 01:07:26,509
And l see it squandered.

1073
01:07:27,478 --> 01:07:30,470
Goddamn it,
an entire generation pumping gas.

1074
01:07:30,998 --> 01:07:32,989
Waiting tables.

1075
01:07:33,078 --> 01:07:35,069
Slaves with white collars.

1076
01:07:37,438 --> 01:07:40,396
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes.

1077
01:07:40,478 --> 01:07:43,629
Working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we don't need.

1078
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:49,713
We're the middle children of history.

1079
01:07:49,798 --> 01:07:51,789
No purpose or place.

1080
01:07:51,958 --> 01:07:53,949
We have no Great War.

1081
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:56,269
No Great Depression.

1082
01:07:57,958 --> 01:08:00,233
Our great war is a spiritual war.

1083
01:08:00,638 --> 01:08:03,869
Our great depression is our lives.

1084
01:08:06,598 --> 01:08:09,556
We've all been raised
on television to believe...

1085
01:08:09,638 --> 01:08:13,153
..that one day we'd be millionaires
and movie gods and rock stars.

1086
01:08:13,238 --> 01:08:15,229
But we won't.

1087
01:08:15,318 --> 01:08:17,673
We're slowly learning that fact.

1088
01:08:17,758 --> 01:08:20,113
And we're very, very pissed off.

1089
01:08:20,198 --> 01:08:21,756
(all) Yeah!

1090
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:28,836
- First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...
- (banging)

1091
01:08:34,078 --> 01:08:35,306
Who are you?

1092
01:08:36,118 --> 01:08:38,632
- Who am l?
- Yeah.

1093
01:08:39,478 --> 01:08:42,197
There's a sign on the front
that says Lou's Tavern.

1094
01:08:43,238 --> 01:08:46,947
l'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?

1095
01:08:47,038 --> 01:08:49,029
Tyler Durden.

1096
01:08:52,038 --> 01:08:55,348
Who told you motherfuckers
that you could use my place?

1097
01:08:55,438 --> 01:08:57,713
We have a deal worked out with lrvine.

1098
01:08:57,798 --> 01:09:00,266
lrvine's at home with a broken collarbone.

1099
01:09:00,358 --> 01:09:02,428
He don't own this place. l do.

1100
01:09:04,518 --> 01:09:07,828
- How much money's he getting for this?
- There is no money.

1101
01:09:07,918 --> 01:09:10,591
- Free to all.
- Ain't that something?

1102
01:09:10,678 --> 01:09:12,430
lt is, actually.

1103
01:09:12,518 --> 01:09:14,873
Look, stupid fuck!

1104
01:09:14,958 --> 01:09:17,392
- l want everybody out of here right now.
- Hey!

1105
01:09:17,478 --> 01:09:19,628
You should join our club.

1106
01:09:19,998 --> 01:09:21,909
Did you hear what l just said?

1107
01:09:21,998 --> 01:09:23,989
You and your friend.

1108
01:09:24,758 --> 01:09:25,747
Uh!

1109
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:27,829
You hear me now?

1110
01:09:29,958 --> 01:09:31,949
No, l didn't quite catch that, Lou.

1111
01:09:35,478 --> 01:09:36,957
(tyyler groans)

1112
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:39,749
Still not getting it.

1113
01:09:40,758 --> 01:09:42,828
Aagh! OK, OK, l got it.

1114
01:09:42,918 --> 01:09:45,273
l got it, l got it. Shit, l lost it.

1115
01:09:46,278 --> 01:09:48,075
Back! All of you!

1116
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:51,709
(bodyguard) Everybody back!

1117
01:09:53,158 --> 01:09:54,989
(tyyler laughs)

1118
01:09:56,798 --> 01:09:58,789
(laughs)

1119
01:09:58,878 --> 01:10:00,948
Ah, Lou!

1120
01:10:01,038 --> 01:10:04,553
Come on, man!
We really like this place.

1121
01:10:05,878 --> 01:10:07,231
(groans)

1122
01:10:07,318 --> 01:10:09,593
(tyyler laughs)

1123
01:10:13,238 --> 01:10:16,036
- That's right, Lou. Get it out.
- Shut the fuck up.

1124
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:17,876
Oh, yeah!

1125
01:10:18,198 --> 01:10:20,393
(laughs)

1126
01:10:22,638 --> 01:10:24,629
ls that fucking funny?

1127
01:10:25,878 --> 01:10:27,869
(laughs hysterically)

1128
01:10:30,758 --> 01:10:33,226
Fucking guy is a loony, l'm telling you.

1129
01:10:35,318 --> 01:10:36,956
Unbelievable.

1130
01:10:40,998 --> 01:10:43,831
- You don't know where l've been, Lou.
- Oh, my God!

1131
01:10:43,918 --> 01:10:46,671
(maniacally) You don't know where l've been!

1132
01:10:49,638 --> 01:10:52,596
Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!

1133
01:10:52,678 --> 01:10:55,033
Fucking use the basement! Christ!

1134
01:10:55,118 --> 01:10:57,871
l want your word, Lou! l want your word!

1135
01:10:57,958 --> 01:10:59,869
On my mother's eyes.

1136
01:11:04,678 --> 01:11:07,431
(Lou groans)

1137
01:11:08,638 --> 01:11:10,629
Thanks, Lou.

1138
01:11:11,918 --> 01:11:13,909
You too, big guy.

1139
01:11:17,718 --> 01:11:19,709
We'll see you next week.

1140
01:11:34,598 --> 01:11:38,034
This week, each one of you
has a homework assignment.

1141
01:11:38,118 --> 01:11:42,748
You're gonna go out. You're gonna
start a fight with a total stranger.

1142
01:11:45,878 --> 01:11:47,948
You're gonna start a fight...

1143
01:11:48,038 --> 01:11:50,029
..and you're gonna lose.

1144
01:11:51,958 --> 01:11:53,789
Excellent choice, sir.

1145
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:59,429
Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!

1146
01:11:59,798 --> 01:12:02,358
Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.

1147
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:06,835
Son of a bitch!

1148
01:12:06,918 --> 01:12:11,469
Most people, normal people,
do just about anything to avoid a fiight.

1149
01:12:12,358 --> 01:12:14,349
Excuse me!

1150
01:12:14,438 --> 01:12:17,987
You sprayed me with your hose.
That's not necessary...

1151
01:12:18,078 --> 01:12:19,909
Jay! Go call 91 1 !

1152
01:12:20,478 --> 01:12:22,469
(screams)

1153
01:12:22,558 --> 01:12:24,514
Put the hose down.

1154
01:12:24,598 --> 01:12:26,589
Stop it! Stop it!

1155
01:12:28,198 --> 01:12:29,995
Sorry.

1156
01:12:44,878 --> 01:12:47,233
We need to talk.

1157
01:12:49,398 --> 01:12:51,389
OK.

1158
01:12:51,478 --> 01:12:53,469
Where to begin?

1159
01:12:53,558 --> 01:12:55,674
With your constant absenteeism?

1160
01:12:55,758 --> 01:12:58,192
With your unpresentable appearance?

1161
01:12:58,278 --> 01:13:00,234
You're up for review.

1162
01:13:00,318 --> 01:13:03,390
l am Jack's complete lack of surprise.

1163
01:13:03,478 --> 01:13:05,309
- What?
- Let's pretend.

1164
01:13:05,398 --> 01:13:08,151
You're the Department of Transportation,
OK?

1165
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:11,753
Someone informs you that this company...

1166
01:13:11,838 --> 01:13:15,751
..installs front-seat mounting brackets
that failed collision tests,...

1167
01:13:15,838 --> 01:13:19,114
..brake linings that fail after 1 ,000 miles,...

1168
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:23,430
..and fuel injectors
that explode and burn people alive.

1169
01:13:23,518 --> 01:13:25,315
What then?

1170
01:13:25,398 --> 01:13:27,593
Are you threatening me?

1171
01:13:27,678 --> 01:13:30,351
- No...
- Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!

1172
01:13:30,438 --> 01:13:34,670
l have a better solution. Keep me
on the payroll as an outside consultant.

1173
01:13:34,758 --> 01:13:36,749
ln exchange for my salary,...

1174
01:13:36,838 --> 01:13:40,513
..my job will be never to tell people
these things that l know.

1175
01:13:40,598 --> 01:13:44,716
l don't even have to come into the office.
l can do this job from home.

1176
01:13:45,958 --> 01:13:49,917
Who... Who the fuck do you think you are,
you crazy little shit?

1177
01:13:54,958 --> 01:13:58,348
- Security!
- l am Jack's smirking revenge.

1178
01:14:04,158 --> 01:14:06,149
Uh!

1179
01:14:06,958 --> 01:14:08,994
What the hell are you doing?

1180
01:14:12,558 --> 01:14:14,549
(splutters)

1181
01:14:17,798 --> 01:14:19,789
Uh, that hurt.

1182
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:23,189
Why would you do that?

1183
01:14:23,798 --> 01:14:26,676
Oh, my God! No! Please stop!

1184
01:14:26,758 --> 01:14:28,749
(chokes)

1185
01:14:35,718 --> 01:14:37,709
What are you doing?

1186
01:14:38,758 --> 01:14:40,749
Oh, God, no! Please! No!

1187
01:14:40,838 --> 01:14:44,751
For some reason,
l thought ofmy fiirst fiight, with Tyler.

1188
01:14:44,838 --> 01:14:46,396
No!

1189
01:15:09,798 --> 01:15:14,110
Under and behind and inside
everything this man took for granted,...

1190
01:15:14,198 --> 01:15:17,508
..something horrible had been growing.

1191
01:15:17,598 --> 01:15:18,633
Look.

1192
01:15:18,718 --> 01:15:23,234
Give me the paychecks, like l asked,
and you won't ever see me again.

1193
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:25,991
Then, at our most excellent
moment together...

1194
01:15:28,918 --> 01:15:31,591
(weeps) Thank God!
Please don't hit me again.

1195
01:15:31,678 --> 01:15:33,669
Telephone, computer,...

1196
01:15:33,758 --> 01:15:38,707
..fax machine, 5.2 weekly paychecks
and 48 airline flight coupons.

1197
01:15:38,798 --> 01:15:41,107
We now had corporate sponsorship.

1198
01:15:41,198 --> 01:15:46,113
This is how Tyler and l were able to have
Fight Club every night of the week.

1199
01:15:46,198 --> 01:15:48,189
(cheering)

1200
01:15:48,678 --> 01:15:52,114
Now, the centre ofFight Club
became the two men fiighting.

1201
01:15:52,198 --> 01:15:55,554
The leader walked through the crowd,
out in the darkness.

1202
01:15:57,238 --> 01:16:01,550
Tyler was now involved in
a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel...

1203
01:16:01,638 --> 01:16:03,833
..over the urine content of their soup.

1204
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:05,712
(cheering)

1205
01:16:08,798 --> 01:16:11,676
l am Jack's wasted life.

1206
01:16:19,078 --> 01:16:21,069
Thank you, sir.

1207
01:16:22,518 --> 01:16:25,396
Tyler dreamed up
new homework assignments.

1208
01:16:25,478 --> 01:16:27,912
He handed them out in sealed envelopes.

1209
01:17:05,478 --> 01:17:08,993
- There's a Fight Club up in Delaware City.
- Yeah, l heard.

1210
01:17:10,718 --> 01:17:12,834
There's one in Penns Grove too.

1211
01:17:12,918 --> 01:17:15,068
Bob even found one up in New Castle.

1212
01:17:15,158 --> 01:17:18,116
- Did you start that one?
- No, l thought you did.

1213
01:17:18,198 --> 01:17:20,587
- No.
- (spits)

1214
01:18:07,438 --> 01:18:09,554
- Stop for a second.
- Hey, what are we doing?

1215
01:18:09,638 --> 01:18:11,594
- Turn around.
- What are we doing?

1216
01:18:11,678 --> 01:18:13,987
- Homework assignment.
- What kind?

1217
01:18:14,078 --> 01:18:16,034
Human sacrifice.

1218
01:18:16,118 --> 01:18:19,315
- ls that a gun? Please tell me it's not.
- lt's a gun.

1219
01:18:19,398 --> 01:18:21,628
- What are you doing?
- Meet me in the back.

1220
01:18:21,718 --> 01:18:23,993
- Don't fuck around!
- Meet me in the back.

1221
01:18:24,078 --> 01:18:25,796
On a long enough time line,...

1222
01:18:25,878 --> 01:18:28,631
..the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.

1223
01:18:29,598 --> 01:18:31,589
What are you doing? Come on!

1224
01:18:31,678 --> 01:18:34,954
Hands behind your back.
Give me your wallet.

1225
01:18:36,638 --> 01:18:39,789
Raymond K Hessel.
1320 SE Banning, Apartment A.

1226
01:18:40,558 --> 01:18:43,630
- Small, cramped basement apartment?
- How did you know?

1227
01:18:43,718 --> 01:18:46,232
They give shitty apartments letters.

1228
01:18:46,318 --> 01:18:49,310
Raymond! You're going to die.

1229
01:18:49,398 --> 01:18:50,797
(sobs) No!

1230
01:18:50,878 --> 01:18:54,871
ls that your mom and dad?
They're gonna have to call the kindly doctor.

1231
01:18:54,958 --> 01:18:57,108
Pick up your dental records. Know why?

1232
01:18:57,198 --> 01:19:00,634
- There'll be nothing left of your face.
- Oh, come on!

1233
01:19:00,718 --> 01:19:04,472
An expired community college student lD.
What did you study, Raymond?

1234
01:19:04,558 --> 01:19:07,470
- S... S... Stuff.
- (tyyler) Stuff?

1235
01:19:07,558 --> 01:19:09,549
Were the midterms hard?

1236
01:19:10,638 --> 01:19:13,106
- l asked you what you studied!
- Biology, mostly.

1237
01:19:13,198 --> 01:19:16,554
- Why?
- l don't know.

1238
01:19:16,638 --> 01:19:19,516
What did you wanna be, Raymond K Hessel?!

1239
01:19:20,878 --> 01:19:24,666
The question, Raymond,
was what did you want to be?

1240
01:19:26,278 --> 01:19:28,269
Answer him, Raymond, Jesus!

1241
01:19:28,358 --> 01:19:30,667
- Veterinarian. Veterinarian.
- Animals.

1242
01:19:30,758 --> 01:19:33,591
- Yeah. Animals and stuff.
- Stuff. Yeah, l got that.

1243
01:19:33,678 --> 01:19:36,146
- So you need more schooling.
- Too much school.

1244
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:38,593
- Would you rather be dead?
- No, please...

1245
01:19:38,678 --> 01:19:42,956
You'd rather die here, on your knees,
in the back of a convenience store?

1246
01:19:43,038 --> 01:19:44,596
(whimpers) Please, no.

1247
01:19:48,518 --> 01:19:50,509
l'm keeping your licence.

1248
01:19:51,718 --> 01:19:54,596
Gonna check in on you.
l know where you live.

1249
01:19:54,678 --> 01:19:57,556
lf you're not working
to be a veterinarian in six weeks,...

1250
01:19:57,638 --> 01:19:59,629
..you will be dead.

1251
01:19:59,718 --> 01:20:01,356
(Raymond sobs)

1252
01:20:01,438 --> 01:20:03,429
Now run on home.

1253
01:20:07,998 --> 01:20:09,989
Run, Forrest, run!

1254
01:20:11,558 --> 01:20:13,549
l feel ill.

1255
01:20:14,318 --> 01:20:16,309
lmagine how he feels.

1256
01:20:16,398 --> 01:20:18,389
Come on, this isn't funny!

1257
01:20:18,478 --> 01:20:20,787
What the fuck was the point of that?!

1258
01:20:20,878 --> 01:20:24,837
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day
of Raymond K Hessel's life.

1259
01:20:24,918 --> 01:20:29,116
His breakfast will taste better
than any meal you and l have ever tasted.

1260
01:20:30,478 --> 01:20:32,469
You had to give it to him.

1261
01:20:32,558 --> 01:20:34,833
- Come on.
- He had a plan.

1262
01:20:34,918 --> 01:20:38,194
And it started to make sense
in a Tyler-sort of way.

1263
01:20:38,278 --> 01:20:40,109
No fear. No distractions.

1264
01:20:40,198 --> 01:20:43,395
The ability to let that which does not matter...

1265
01:20:43,478 --> 01:20:45,389
..truly slide.

1266
01:20:58,238 --> 01:21:00,274
(tyyler) You are not yourjob.

1267
01:21:02,118 --> 01:21:05,349
You're not how much money
you have in the bank.

1268
01:21:06,998 --> 01:21:08,989
You're not the car you drive.

1269
01:21:09,518 --> 01:21:12,237
You're not the contents of your wallet.

1270
01:21:12,318 --> 01:21:14,513
You're not your fucking khakis.

1271
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:20,787
You are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1272
01:21:29,278 --> 01:21:31,394
l'll be out of your way in a sec.

1273
01:21:32,158 --> 01:21:34,149
You don't have to go.

1274
01:21:35,598 --> 01:21:37,589
Whatever.

1275
01:21:38,678 --> 01:21:41,636
No, l mean... lt's OK.

1276
01:21:42,958 --> 01:21:44,755
(distant clattering)

1277
01:21:48,718 --> 01:21:50,709
(footsteps)

1278
01:21:50,798 --> 01:21:52,789
Are you still going to groups?

1279
01:21:53,478 --> 01:21:55,469
Yeah.

1280
01:21:56,878 --> 01:21:58,869
Chloe's dead.

1281
01:21:59,358 --> 01:22:01,269
Wow, Chloe.

1282
01:22:01,358 --> 01:22:03,189
When did that happen?

1283
01:22:03,718 --> 01:22:05,515
Do you care?

1284
01:22:05,598 --> 01:22:08,829
l dunno. l haven't thought about it in a while.

1285
01:22:09,078 --> 01:22:11,069
Yeah, well...

1286
01:22:11,158 --> 01:22:13,433
lt was the smart move on her part.

1287
01:22:14,758 --> 01:22:16,714
Listen, um...

1288
01:22:17,918 --> 01:22:20,193
What are you getting out of all this?

1289
01:22:20,878 --> 01:22:22,869
What?

1290
01:22:22,998 --> 01:22:25,228
l mean, all this. Why do you keep...

1291
01:22:25,958 --> 01:22:27,949
ls this making you happy?

1292
01:22:29,478 --> 01:22:31,469
Yeah, well, sometimes.

1293
01:22:33,118 --> 01:22:35,154
l don't know. l don't understand.

1294
01:22:35,238 --> 01:22:38,674
Why does a weaker person
need to latch on to a strong person?

1295
01:22:38,758 --> 01:22:40,749
What is... What is that?

1296
01:22:40,838 --> 01:22:42,908
What do you get out of it?

1297
01:22:44,358 --> 01:22:46,349
No... That's not the same thing at all.

1298
01:22:46,438 --> 01:22:48,429
lt's totally different with us.

1299
01:22:48,518 --> 01:22:50,509
- Us?
- (clattering increases)

1300
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:52,429
What do you mean by us?

1301
01:22:52,518 --> 01:22:56,227
- l'm sorry. Do you hear this?
- Hear what?

1302
01:22:56,318 --> 01:22:58,274
- All that noise. Hold on.
- No, wait!

1303
01:22:58,358 --> 01:23:00,952
Don't change the subject!
l want to talk about this.

1304
01:23:01,038 --> 01:23:03,711
- You're not talking about me, are you?
- No.

1305
01:23:03,798 --> 01:23:07,108
- What?
- Playing doctor. What was going on there?

1306
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:10,315
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1307
01:23:10,398 --> 01:23:12,389
- l don't think so.
- What do you want?

1308
01:23:12,478 --> 01:23:14,787
- Look at me.
- No. What?

1309
01:23:15,518 --> 01:23:18,237
- What is that?!
- lt's nothing. Don't worry.

1310
01:23:18,318 --> 01:23:20,627
My God. Who did this?

1311
01:23:20,718 --> 01:23:22,709
- A person.
- Guy or girl?

1312
01:23:22,798 --> 01:23:25,471
- What do you care?
- What do you care if l ask?

1313
01:23:25,558 --> 01:23:28,026
- Leave me alone.
- You're afraid to say.

1314
01:23:28,118 --> 01:23:30,029
- l am not. Let me go.
- No! Talk to me.

1315
01:23:30,118 --> 01:23:31,233
Let go of me!

1316
01:23:31,318 --> 01:23:33,912
- This conversation...
- This conversation...

1317
01:23:33,998 --> 01:23:36,387
- ..is over.
- ..is over.

1318
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:40,190
l just can't win with you, can l?

1319
01:23:49,118 --> 01:23:51,507
Hey, this is getting a little old!

1320
01:23:52,078 --> 01:23:54,308
What is... What is all this?

1321
01:23:54,398 --> 01:23:56,389
What do you think?

1322
01:23:57,318 --> 01:23:59,354
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?

1323
01:23:59,438 --> 01:24:01,235
Hey!

1324
01:24:07,758 --> 01:24:09,510
Too young.

1325
01:24:09,598 --> 01:24:11,156
Sorry.

1326
01:24:11,238 --> 01:24:13,229
What's all that?

1327
01:24:13,318 --> 01:24:16,151
lf the applicant is young,
tell him he's too young.

1328
01:24:16,238 --> 01:24:18,752
- Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
- Applicant?

1329
01:24:18,838 --> 01:24:22,069
lf the applicant waits three days
without food or shelter,...

1330
01:24:22,158 --> 01:24:24,149
..he may enter and begin training.

1331
01:24:24,238 --> 01:24:25,990
Training for what?

1332
01:24:31,358 --> 01:24:33,349
You think this is a game?

1333
01:24:33,438 --> 01:24:35,998
You're too young to train here, end of story.

1334
01:24:36,078 --> 01:24:38,717
Quit wasting our time.
Get the fuck out of here.

1335
01:24:39,158 --> 01:24:41,149
(door opens)

1336
01:24:42,478 --> 01:24:44,469
Bad news, friend.

1337
01:24:44,718 --> 01:24:46,709
lt's not gonna happen.

1338
01:24:46,798 --> 01:24:48,993
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.

1339
01:24:49,078 --> 01:24:50,909
lt's not the end of the world.

1340
01:24:50,998 --> 01:24:53,114
Just... go away.

1341
01:24:53,958 --> 01:24:55,914
Go.

1342
01:24:55,998 --> 01:24:59,513
You're trespassing
and l will have to call the police.

1343
01:25:02,478 --> 01:25:04,469
Don't you look at me!

1344
01:25:04,558 --> 01:25:07,675
You're never getting in this fucking house!

1345
01:25:07,758 --> 01:25:10,989
Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!
Get off my porch!

1346
01:25:11,078 --> 01:25:14,468
Sooner or later,
we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.

1347
01:25:14,558 --> 01:25:17,277
l'm gonna go inside
and l'm gonna get a shovel.

1348
01:25:24,518 --> 01:25:26,634
- Got two black shirts?
- Yes, sir.

1349
01:25:26,718 --> 01:25:28,868
- Two pair of black pants?
- Yes, sir.

1350
01:25:28,958 --> 01:25:31,791
- One pair black boots? Black socks?
- Yes, sir.

1351
01:25:31,878 --> 01:25:33,869
- One black jacket.
- Yes, sir.

1352
01:25:33,958 --> 01:25:36,836
- $300 personal burial money?
- Yes, sir.

1353
01:25:38,918 --> 01:25:40,909
All right.

1354
01:25:50,318 --> 01:25:52,309
You're too old, fat man.

1355
01:25:52,398 --> 01:25:55,435
Your tits are too big.
Get the fuck off my porch.

1356
01:26:02,918 --> 01:26:04,909
Bob! Bob!

1357
01:26:20,238 --> 01:26:22,798
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.

1358
01:26:23,518 --> 01:26:24,951
Space monkey.

1359
01:26:25,038 --> 01:26:28,394
Ready to sacrifice himself
for the greater good.

1360
01:26:34,758 --> 01:26:37,318
You are too fucking old, fatty!

1361
01:26:37,398 --> 01:26:40,470
And you... You're too fucking...

1362
01:26:40,558 --> 01:26:42,116
..blond!

1363
01:26:42,198 --> 01:26:44,428
Get out of here, the both of you!

1364
01:26:44,518 --> 01:26:46,509
And so it went.

1365
01:26:46,678 --> 01:26:48,714
(tyyler) Listen up, maggots.

1366
01:26:48,798 --> 01:26:50,789
You are not special.

1367
01:26:51,118 --> 01:26:54,269
You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.

1368
01:26:54,358 --> 01:26:58,556
You are the same decaying organic matter
as everything else.

1369
01:26:58,638 --> 01:27:00,674
Tyler built himseifan army.

1370
01:27:00,878 --> 01:27:04,393
(tyyler) We are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1371
01:27:04,478 --> 01:27:07,948
We are all part of the same compost heap.

1372
01:27:08,958 --> 01:27:12,075
(thinks)
Why was Tyler Durden building an army?

1373
01:27:12,158 --> 01:27:14,149
To what purpose?

1374
01:27:14,238 --> 01:27:16,547
For what greater good?

1375
01:27:19,758 --> 01:27:21,749
ln Tyler we trusted.

1376
01:27:26,838 --> 01:27:29,432
(man) When he was like,
''You are not your job'',...

1377
01:27:29,518 --> 01:27:31,509
..l was like, ''Yeah!''

1378
01:27:33,318 --> 01:27:35,309
Hey, what's all this?

1379
01:27:35,398 --> 01:27:37,389
Hey!

1380
01:27:38,838 --> 01:27:40,430
OK!

1381
01:27:40,518 --> 01:27:42,793
- What's going on?
- We're celebrating.

1382
01:27:42,878 --> 01:27:45,267
- What are we celebrating?
- Go on.

1383
01:27:46,518 --> 01:27:48,509
(TV on)

1384
01:27:49,118 --> 01:27:51,188
- Hey.
- Let me get that for you.

1385
01:27:55,598 --> 01:27:58,396
(TV) The same great taste, Pepsi.

1386
01:28:00,638 --> 01:28:02,788
(all) Ssh!

1387
01:28:02,878 --> 01:28:06,507
(TV) lnvestigators are here.
The Police Commissioner has arrived.

1388
01:28:06,598 --> 01:28:09,431
Could you tell us
what you think has happened here?

1389
01:28:09,518 --> 01:28:13,591
We believe this is one ofmany
recent acts of vandalism in the city...

1390
01:28:13,678 --> 01:28:16,670
..somehow related
to underground boxing clubs.

1391
01:28:16,758 --> 01:28:20,797
We will be coordinating
a rigorous investigation.

1392
01:28:21,678 --> 01:28:25,876
That was Police Commissioner Jacobs
who just arrived on the scene...

1393
01:28:25,958 --> 01:28:30,031
- ..ofa four-alarm fiire that broke out...
- She's hot.

1394
01:28:30,118 --> 01:28:31,870
Back to you in the studio.

1395
01:28:31,958 --> 01:28:34,233
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1396
01:28:35,158 --> 01:28:37,592
- Holy shit!
- Yeah!

1397
01:28:44,598 --> 01:28:46,554
What the fuck did you guys do?

1398
01:28:46,638 --> 01:28:50,551
(TV) Arson investigators
are on the premises...

1399
01:28:50,638 --> 01:28:52,515
(laughter)

1400
01:28:54,158 --> 01:28:58,549
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions, sir.

1401
01:29:04,518 --> 01:29:06,907
The victory in the war against crime...

1402
01:29:06,998 --> 01:29:08,989
..will not come overnight.

1403
01:29:09,078 --> 01:29:13,435
lt will take dedication and commitment
and, most of all, cooperation.

1404
01:29:13,518 --> 01:29:18,228
Streets are safer now.
There is hope in the inner city. However...

1405
01:29:18,318 --> 01:29:20,229
l gotta take a piss.

1406
01:29:20,318 --> 01:29:22,957
These are the first steps in a long journey.

1407
01:29:23,038 --> 01:29:25,552
That is why we have created Project Hope.

1408
01:29:25,638 --> 01:29:27,629
Bob.

1409
01:29:30,598 --> 01:29:33,271
(speaker)
Project Hope will be a joint effort...

1410
01:29:33,358 --> 01:29:35,997
..between the police and community leaders.

1411
01:29:36,078 --> 01:29:40,071
lt will be a powerful new weapon
in the war against crime.

1412
01:29:40,158 --> 01:29:42,149
(applause)

1413
01:30:14,278 --> 01:30:16,269
(waiter yells)

1414
01:30:23,638 --> 01:30:27,631
- Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack.
- His balls are ice cold.

1415
01:30:29,558 --> 01:30:32,755
Hi. You're gonna call off
your rigorous investigation.

1416
01:30:32,838 --> 01:30:36,035
You will publicly state
there is no underground group or...

1417
01:30:36,118 --> 01:30:38,348
..these guys are gonna take your balls.

1418
01:30:39,198 --> 01:30:42,827
They'll send one to the New York Times
and one to the LA Times.

1419
01:30:42,918 --> 01:30:44,590
Look.

1420
01:30:44,678 --> 01:30:47,636
The people you are after
are the people you depend on.

1421
01:30:47,718 --> 01:30:51,154
We cook your meals. We haul your trash.
We connect your calls.

1422
01:30:51,238 --> 01:30:54,833
We drive your ambulances.
We guard you while you sleep.

1423
01:30:59,078 --> 01:31:01,751
Do not fuck with us.

1424
01:31:06,198 --> 01:31:08,189
(muffled yell)

1425
01:31:08,878 --> 01:31:10,914
Ball check!

1426
01:31:24,678 --> 01:31:26,669
Bob, you're this way.

1427
01:31:27,718 --> 01:31:29,948
Let's go.

1428
01:31:30,038 --> 01:31:33,110
l am Jack's inflamed sense ofrejection.

1429
01:31:34,158 --> 01:31:36,149
Hey!

1430
01:31:50,038 --> 01:31:51,266
Yeah!

1431
01:31:52,718 --> 01:31:54,709
(shouts of encouragement)

1432
01:31:57,038 --> 01:31:58,312
(cheering)

1433
01:32:21,718 --> 01:32:24,391
l felt like putting a bullet in every panda...

1434
01:32:24,478 --> 01:32:28,232
..that wouldn't screw to save its species.

1435
01:32:29,398 --> 01:32:31,753
l wanted to open the dump valves
on oil tankers...

1436
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:35,797
..and smother all those French beaches
l'd never see.

1437
01:32:38,518 --> 01:32:40,907
l wanted to breathe smoke.

1438
01:32:56,718 --> 01:32:58,754
Where did you go, psycho boy?

1439
01:33:00,438 --> 01:33:03,236
l felt like destroying something beautiful.

1440
01:33:06,598 --> 01:33:08,589
Get him to a fucking hospital.

1441
01:33:08,678 --> 01:33:10,669
Yeah.

1442
01:33:20,998 --> 01:33:23,956
Don't worry, Mr Durden.
Airport parking. Long term.

1443
01:33:25,398 --> 01:33:27,389
After you, Mr Durden.

1444
01:33:28,318 --> 01:33:30,309
After you.

1445
01:33:47,398 --> 01:33:49,866
- Something on your mind, dear?
- No.

1446
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:53,075
Yeah, why wasn't l told
about Project Mayhem?

1447
01:33:53,158 --> 01:33:56,036
First rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions.

1448
01:33:56,118 --> 01:33:58,393
Why didn't you include me in the beginning?

1449
01:33:58,478 --> 01:34:03,472
Fight Club was the beginning. Now it's left
the basements and it's Project Mayhem.

1450
01:34:03,558 --> 01:34:07,756
We started Fight Club together. Remember?
lt's as much mine as it is yours.

1451
01:34:07,838 --> 01:34:11,911
- ls this about you and me?
- Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?

1452
01:34:11,998 --> 01:34:15,308
This does not belong to us.
We are not special.

1453
01:34:15,398 --> 01:34:17,707
Fuck that. You should have told me.

1454
01:34:18,518 --> 01:34:20,429
- Hey, Tyler!
- (horn blares)

1455
01:34:22,198 --> 01:34:24,587
- Goddamn it, Tyler!
- What do you want?!

1456
01:34:24,678 --> 01:34:27,033
A statement of purpose?
Should l e-mail you?

1457
01:34:27,118 --> 01:34:29,678
- Oh...
- You decide your level of involvement!

1458
01:34:29,758 --> 01:34:32,318
l will! l wanna know certain things first!

1459
01:34:32,398 --> 01:34:34,912
- The first rule of Project Mayhem...
- Shut up!

1460
01:34:36,598 --> 01:34:40,193
- l wanna know what you're thinking.
- Fuck what you know!

1461
01:34:40,278 --> 01:34:43,588
Forget about what you think you know
about life, friendship,...

1462
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:45,669
..and especially about you and me.

1463
01:34:46,798 --> 01:34:48,868
What is that supposed to mean?

1464
01:34:52,118 --> 01:34:54,188
What are you doing?

1465
01:34:55,078 --> 01:34:57,672
What do you wish you'd done
before you died?

1466
01:34:57,758 --> 01:35:00,511
- Paint a self-portrait.
- Build a house.

1467
01:35:00,598 --> 01:35:02,873
- And you?
- l don't know. Nothing.

1468
01:35:02,958 --> 01:35:05,267
- Get in the right lane.
- You have to know!

1469
01:35:05,358 --> 01:35:08,270
lf you died now,
how would you feel about your life?

1470
01:35:08,358 --> 01:35:11,873
l don't know! Nothing good.
ls that what you want to hear?

1471
01:35:11,958 --> 01:35:14,153
- Come on!
- Not good enough.

1472
01:35:14,238 --> 01:35:16,593
Stop fucking around! Tyler!

1473
01:35:17,798 --> 01:35:19,948
- (horns blare)
- Jesus Christ!

1474
01:35:20,678 --> 01:35:22,669
Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck you!

1475
01:35:22,758 --> 01:35:24,749
Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!

1476
01:35:24,838 --> 01:35:27,398
l am sick of all your shit!

1477
01:35:27,478 --> 01:35:29,309
OK, man.

1478
01:35:31,038 --> 01:35:33,472
- Quit screwing around. Steer!
- Look at you!

1479
01:35:33,558 --> 01:35:36,197
- Steer!
- Look at you. You're fucking pathetic!

1480
01:35:36,278 --> 01:35:41,193
- Why? Why? What are you talking about?
- Why do you think l blew up your condo?

1481
01:35:41,798 --> 01:35:43,277
What?

1482
01:35:43,358 --> 01:35:47,112
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.
lt's not a goddamned seminar.

1483
01:35:47,198 --> 01:35:50,747
Stop trying to control everything
and just let go!

1484
01:35:52,398 --> 01:35:54,195
Let go!

1485
01:35:54,278 --> 01:35:56,269
All right. Fine.

1486
01:35:57,118 --> 01:35:58,949
Fine.

1487
01:36:54,918 --> 01:36:57,307
l'd never been in a car accident.

1488
01:36:57,398 --> 01:37:00,674
This must have been
what all those people felt like...

1489
01:37:00,758 --> 01:37:03,830
..before l fiiled them
as statistics in my reports.

1490
01:37:03,918 --> 01:37:05,909
Goddamn!

1491
01:37:07,198 --> 01:37:09,189
(tyyler laughs)

1492
01:37:09,278 --> 01:37:12,315
We've just had a near-life experience!

1493
01:37:15,998 --> 01:37:17,909
(tyyler) ln the world l see,...

1494
01:37:17,998 --> 01:37:21,707
..you're stalking elk
through the Grand Canyon forests...

1495
01:37:21,798 --> 01:37:24,676
..around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.

1496
01:37:26,598 --> 01:37:30,796
You'll wear leather clothes
that will last you the rest of your life.

1497
01:37:30,878 --> 01:37:35,235
You'll climb the thick kudzu vines
that wrap the Sears Tower.

1498
01:37:35,318 --> 01:37:39,709
And when you look down,
you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,...

1499
01:37:39,798 --> 01:37:43,188
..laying strips of venison
in the empty car-pool lane...

1500
01:37:43,278 --> 01:37:45,473
..of some abandoned superhighway.

1501
01:37:58,358 --> 01:38:00,508
Feel better, champ.

1502
01:38:05,998 --> 01:38:07,989
(door slams shut)

1503
01:38:17,158 --> 01:38:18,876
And then...

1504
01:38:18,958 --> 01:38:20,437
Tyler?

1505
01:38:20,518 --> 01:38:22,509
..Tyler was gone.

1506
01:38:29,638 --> 01:38:31,594
Was l asleep?

1507
01:38:32,638 --> 01:38:34,594
Had l slept?

1508
01:38:34,678 --> 01:38:37,590
(man)
You are not a beautiful, unique snowflake...

1509
01:38:37,678 --> 01:38:40,033
The house had become a living thing.

1510
01:38:40,118 --> 01:38:44,555
Wet inside from so many people
sweating and breathing.

1511
01:38:45,038 --> 01:38:47,506
So many people moving, the house moved.

1512
01:38:50,278 --> 01:38:52,269
Planet Tyler.

1513
01:38:52,358 --> 01:38:54,349
l had to hug the walls.

1514
01:38:54,438 --> 01:38:57,430
Trapped inside
this clockwork ofspace monkeys.

1515
01:38:57,518 --> 01:39:01,147
You shouldn't be smoking in here!
You know how much ether is here!

1516
01:39:01,238 --> 01:39:03,627
Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.

1517
01:39:03,718 --> 01:39:05,709
(phone rings)

1518
01:39:05,798 --> 01:39:07,789
Hang on a second.

1519
01:39:12,518 --> 01:39:14,156
(police radio)

1520
01:39:25,918 --> 01:39:28,512
lt's under control, sir.

1521
01:39:30,878 --> 01:39:32,630
Where's Tyler?

1522
01:39:32,718 --> 01:39:35,596
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not...

1523
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:37,555
Right... OK.

1524
01:39:39,878 --> 01:39:41,869
l'm all alone.

1525
01:39:42,038 --> 01:39:45,553
My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.

1526
01:39:45,638 --> 01:39:47,788
l am Jack's broken heart.

1527
01:39:51,838 --> 01:39:55,467
What comes next in Project Mayhem
only Tyler knows.

1528
01:39:56,358 --> 01:39:59,430
The second rule is you do not ask questions.

1529
01:40:02,118 --> 01:40:04,712
Get the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away!

1530
01:40:05,078 --> 01:40:07,069
Who are all these people?

1531
01:40:12,118 --> 01:40:14,313
The Paper Street Soap Company.

1532
01:40:15,798 --> 01:40:17,789
Can l come in?

1533
01:40:20,798 --> 01:40:22,789
He's not here.

1534
01:40:22,878 --> 01:40:24,994
What?

1535
01:40:25,998 --> 01:40:29,434
Tyler isn't here.

1536
01:40:29,518 --> 01:40:31,509
Tyler went away.

1537
01:40:31,918 --> 01:40:33,909
Tyler's gone.

1538
01:40:37,558 --> 01:40:39,549
(car horns blare)

1539
01:40:43,118 --> 01:40:45,109
(dogs bark)

1540
01:40:50,238 --> 01:40:51,876
(man) Get some help!

1541
01:40:51,958 --> 01:40:54,313
(yelling)

1542
01:41:02,638 --> 01:41:07,314
Two gunshot wounds coming through!
Make some fucking room!

1543
01:41:07,398 --> 01:41:09,707
What happened? What happened?

1544
01:41:09,798 --> 01:41:12,551
We were on assignment. We were supposed
to kill two birds with one stone.

1545
01:41:13,798 --> 01:41:15,789
Destroy a piece of corporate art...

1546
01:41:15,878 --> 01:41:18,267
Operation Latte Thunder. Go!

1547
01:41:18,958 --> 01:41:21,995
..and trash a franchise coffee bar.

1548
01:41:28,158 --> 01:41:30,388
We had it all worked out, sir.

1549
01:41:38,238 --> 01:41:41,389
- lt went smooth until...
- Police! Freeze!

1550
01:41:41,478 --> 01:41:44,117
- What?
- They shot Bob.

1551
01:41:45,558 --> 01:41:47,867
- They shot him in the head.
- Fucking pigs!

1552
01:41:50,198 --> 01:41:52,109
(groans of disgust)

1553
01:41:53,038 --> 01:41:54,994
Oh, God!

1554
01:41:55,078 --> 01:41:58,195
- Those motherfuckers!
- You morons.

1555
01:41:58,278 --> 01:42:02,237
You're running around in ski masks
trying to blow things up?

1556
01:42:02,318 --> 01:42:04,878
What did you think was gonna happen?!

1557
01:42:06,598 --> 01:42:10,750
OK, quick! Get rid of the evidence.
We gotta get rid of this body!

1558
01:42:10,838 --> 01:42:13,591
- Bury him.
- What?

1559
01:42:13,678 --> 01:42:15,828
Take him to the garden and bury him.

1560
01:42:15,918 --> 01:42:18,671
- Come on, people, let's go!
- Get the fuck off!

1561
01:42:18,758 --> 01:42:21,875
Get away from him!
What are you talking about?

1562
01:42:21,958 --> 01:42:24,426
This isn't fucking evidence.
This is a person.

1563
01:42:24,518 --> 01:42:27,590
He's my friend
and you're not burying him in the garden!

1564
01:42:27,678 --> 01:42:30,556
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.

1565
01:42:30,638 --> 01:42:32,594
- This is Bob.
- Sir, in...

1566
01:42:32,678 --> 01:42:34,669
ln Project Mayhem, we have no names.

1567
01:42:34,758 --> 01:42:36,669
Now, you listen to me.

1568
01:42:36,758 --> 01:42:41,115
This is a man and he has a name,
and it's Robert Paulsen, OK?

1569
01:42:41,198 --> 01:42:43,029
- Robert Paulsen.
- He's a man...

1570
01:42:43,118 --> 01:42:45,837
..and he's dead now because of us.
Do you understand that?

1571
01:42:46,478 --> 01:42:48,673
l understand.

1572
01:42:50,838 --> 01:42:54,035
ln death, a member of Project Mayhem...

1573
01:42:54,118 --> 01:42:56,109
..has a name.

1574
01:42:56,238 --> 01:42:59,036
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1575
01:42:59,478 --> 01:43:01,469
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1576
01:43:02,238 --> 01:43:04,798
His name... is Robert Paulsen.

1577
01:43:04,878 --> 01:43:08,553
(all) His name is Robert Paulsen.

1578
01:43:08,638 --> 01:43:11,596
- Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.
- (all chant)

1579
01:43:11,678 --> 01:43:14,146
(chanting) His name is Robert Paulsen.

1580
01:43:14,238 --> 01:43:17,196
- (chanting)
- Shut up! This is all over with!

1581
01:43:17,278 --> 01:43:18,950
(chanting)

1582
01:43:20,318 --> 01:43:22,707
(whispers) Get the fuck out of here.

1583
01:43:22,798 --> 01:43:24,789
(chanting)

1584
01:43:30,278 --> 01:43:32,269
(chanting continues)

1585
01:43:48,278 --> 01:43:50,189
(phone rings)

1586
01:43:50,278 --> 01:43:54,510
- Tyler?
- No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit.

1587
01:43:54,598 --> 01:43:56,111
l need to see you...

1588
01:44:00,438 --> 01:44:04,317
l went to all the cities
on Tyler's used ticket stubs, barhopping.

1589
01:44:04,398 --> 01:44:08,949
l didn't know how or why, but l could look
at 5.0 different bars, and somehow ljust knew.

1590
01:44:09,038 --> 01:44:13,429
l'm looking for Tyler Durden.
lt's very important that l talk to him.

1591
01:44:13,518 --> 01:44:15,110
l wish l could help you,...

1592
01:44:15,198 --> 01:44:17,393
..sir.

1593
01:44:22,478 --> 01:44:24,469
Every city l went to,...

1594
01:44:25,478 --> 01:44:27,787
..as soon as l set foot off the plane...

1595
01:44:28,358 --> 01:44:30,553
..l knew a Fight Club was close.

1596
01:44:30,638 --> 01:44:32,230
Hey! Hey!

1597
01:44:33,278 --> 01:44:34,791
Taxi!

1598
01:44:34,878 --> 01:44:36,869
Look at my face. l'm a member.

1599
01:44:36,958 --> 01:44:39,392
Now, l just need to know if you've seen Tyler.

1600
01:44:39,478 --> 01:44:43,027
l'm not exposed to bespeak
any such information to you...

1601
01:44:43,118 --> 01:44:47,634
..nor would l, even if l had
said information at this juncture,... be able.

1602
01:44:48,278 --> 01:44:51,827
- You're a moron.
- l'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1603
01:44:53,118 --> 01:44:57,953
Tyler had been busy...
setting up franchises all over the country.

1604
01:45:00,598 --> 01:45:04,876
Was l asleep? Had l slept?

1605
01:45:04,958 --> 01:45:07,108
ls Tyler my bad dream, or am l Tyler's?

1606
01:45:08,438 --> 01:45:11,396
- We've just heard the stories.
- What kind of stories?

1607
01:45:11,478 --> 01:45:15,551
- Nobody knows what he looks like.
- He has plastic surgery every three years.

1608
01:45:15,638 --> 01:45:18,550
That's the stupidest thing
l've ever heard.

1609
01:45:18,638 --> 01:45:22,517
- ls it true about Fight Club in Miami?
- ls Mr Durden building an army?

1610
01:45:22,598 --> 01:45:25,556
l was living in a state ofperpetual deja vu.

1611
01:45:26,318 --> 01:45:28,309
Everywhere l went,...

1612
01:45:28,398 --> 01:45:30,275
..l felt l'd already been there.

1613
01:45:30,358 --> 01:45:33,156
lt was like following an invisible man.

1614
01:45:34,198 --> 01:45:36,189
The smell of dried blood,...

1615
01:45:36,278 --> 01:45:39,668
..dirty, bare footprints circling each other.

1616
01:45:40,478 --> 01:45:43,550
That aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.

1617
01:45:43,638 --> 01:45:47,028
The feel ofa floor still warm
from a fiight the night before.

1618
01:45:47,878 --> 01:45:50,676
l was alwaysjust one step behind Tyler.

1619
01:45:53,478 --> 01:45:56,470
(chanting) His name is Robert Paulsen...

1620
01:46:00,918 --> 01:46:02,909
(man) Welcome back, sir.

1621
01:46:03,838 --> 01:46:05,829
How have you been?

1622
01:46:05,918 --> 01:46:07,988
Do you know me?

1623
01:46:08,078 --> 01:46:10,387
ls this a test, sir?

1624
01:46:10,478 --> 01:46:12,275
No. This is not a test.

1625
01:46:12,358 --> 01:46:14,474
You were in here last Thursday.

1626
01:46:15,038 --> 01:46:17,233
Thursday?

1627
01:46:17,318 --> 01:46:21,106
You were standing where you are now,
asking how good security is.

1628
01:46:21,758 --> 01:46:23,749
lt's tight as a drum, sir.

1629
01:46:26,318 --> 01:46:28,388
Who do you think l am?

1630
01:46:28,478 --> 01:46:30,912
Are you sure this isn't a test?

1631
01:46:30,998 --> 01:46:32,829
No, this is not a test.

1632
01:46:32,918 --> 01:46:34,909
You're Mr Durden.

1633
01:46:36,198 --> 01:46:38,758
You're the one who gave me this.

1634
01:46:38,838 --> 01:46:42,877
Please return your seat backs
to their full upright and locked position.

1635
01:46:50,198 --> 01:46:52,189
(phone rings)

1636
01:46:53,838 --> 01:46:55,829
- Yeah?
- Marla, it's me.

1637
01:46:55,918 --> 01:46:57,795
- Have we ever done it?
- Done what?

1638
01:46:57,878 --> 01:46:59,197
Had sex?

1639
01:46:59,278 --> 01:47:01,348
What kind of stupid question is that?

1640
01:47:01,438 --> 01:47:03,713
Stupid because it's yes
or because it's no?

1641
01:47:03,798 --> 01:47:06,266
- ls this a trick?
- No. l need to know...

1642
01:47:06,358 --> 01:47:10,067
You wanna know if l think
we were just having sex or making love?

1643
01:47:10,158 --> 01:47:13,434
- We did make love?
- ls that what you're calling it?

1644
01:47:13,518 --> 01:47:16,237
Just answer the question!
Did we do it or not?!

1645
01:47:16,318 --> 01:47:19,116
You fuck me, then snub me.
You love me, you hate me.

1646
01:47:19,198 --> 01:47:21,951
You're sensitive,
then you turn into an asshole.

1647
01:47:22,038 --> 01:47:24,598
Does that describe our relationship, Tyler?

1648
01:47:24,678 --> 01:47:26,669
(thinks) Wejust lost cabin pressure.

1649
01:47:26,758 --> 01:47:28,191
What did you just say?

1650
01:47:28,278 --> 01:47:30,508
- What is wrong with you?
- Say my name!

1651
01:47:30,598 --> 01:47:34,113
Tyler Durden!
You fucking freak! What's going on?

1652
01:47:34,198 --> 01:47:36,189
- l'm coming over!
- l'm not there!

1653
01:47:36,278 --> 01:47:38,951
- (line goes dead)
- You broke your promise.

1654
01:47:39,038 --> 01:47:40,915
Jesus, Tyler.

1655
01:47:40,998 --> 01:47:44,308
- You fucking talked to her about me.
- What the fuck is going on?

1656
01:47:44,398 --> 01:47:47,708
l asked you for one thing. One simple thing.

1657
01:47:47,798 --> 01:47:50,028
Why do people think that l'm you?

1658
01:47:50,558 --> 01:47:52,549
Answer me!

1659
01:47:54,838 --> 01:47:56,590
Sit.

1660
01:47:59,278 --> 01:48:01,872
Answer me. Why do people think l'm you?

1661
01:48:01,958 --> 01:48:04,028
l think you know.

1662
01:48:04,158 --> 01:48:06,626
- No, l don't.
- Yes, you do.

1663
01:48:06,718 --> 01:48:09,357
Why would anyone
possibly confuse you with me?

1664
01:48:09,438 --> 01:48:12,111
l... l don't know.

1665
01:48:16,678 --> 01:48:19,431
- You got it.
- No.

1666
01:48:19,518 --> 01:48:21,554
- Do not fuck with us!
- Say it.

1667
01:48:22,878 --> 01:48:24,834
Because...

1668
01:48:26,118 --> 01:48:27,233
Say it!

1669
01:48:28,838 --> 01:48:30,794
Because we're the same person.

1670
01:48:30,878 --> 01:48:32,914
That's right.

1671
01:48:32,998 --> 01:48:35,068
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap.

1672
01:48:35,158 --> 01:48:38,707
- l don't understand this.
- You wanted a way to change your life.

1673
01:48:38,798 --> 01:48:40,789
You could not do this on your own.

1674
01:48:40,878 --> 01:48:42,869
All the ways you wish you could be,...

1675
01:48:42,958 --> 01:48:44,755
..that's me.

1676
01:48:44,838 --> 01:48:47,875
l look like you wanna look,
l fuck like you wanna fuck.

1677
01:48:47,958 --> 01:48:50,188
l am smart, capable and, most importantly,...

1678
01:48:50,278 --> 01:48:52,917
..l'm free in all the ways that you are not.

1679
01:48:52,998 --> 01:48:53,953
Oh, no.

1680
01:48:54,038 --> 01:48:56,836
- Tyler's not here. Tyler went away.
- What?

1681
01:48:56,918 --> 01:48:59,148
This isn't possible. This is crazy.

1682
01:48:59,238 --> 01:49:01,194
People do it every day.

1683
01:49:01,278 --> 01:49:04,668
They talk to themselves.
They see themselves as they'd like to be.

1684
01:49:04,758 --> 01:49:07,875
They don't have the courage you have
to just run with it.

1685
01:49:11,518 --> 01:49:14,749
You still wrestle with it,
so sometimes you're still you.

1686
01:49:14,838 --> 01:49:19,354
- We should do this again sometime.
- At times, you imagine you're watching me.

1687
01:49:19,438 --> 01:49:21,827
lf this is your first time, you have to fight.

1688
01:49:21,918 --> 01:49:26,116
Little by little,
you're just letting yourself become...

1689
01:49:26,918 --> 01:49:28,749
..Tyler Durden.

1690
01:49:28,838 --> 01:49:31,511
You are not your job
or how much money you have!

1691
01:49:31,598 --> 01:49:33,907
- No. You have a house.
- Rented in your name.

1692
01:49:33,998 --> 01:49:37,468
- You have jobs, a life.
- You work nights because you can't sleep.

1693
01:49:37,558 --> 01:49:39,276
Or you stay up and make soap.

1694
01:49:39,358 --> 01:49:44,113
- You're fucking Marla, Tyler.
- Technically, you are. lt's all the same to her.

1695
01:49:45,758 --> 01:49:47,714
Oh, my God.

1696
01:49:48,678 --> 01:49:50,669
Now you see our dilemma.

1697
01:49:50,758 --> 01:49:52,953
She knows too much.

1698
01:49:53,038 --> 01:49:57,953
l think we're gonna have to talk about
how this might compromise our goals.

1699
01:49:58,038 --> 01:50:00,074
What... What are you saying?

1700
01:50:00,998 --> 01:50:05,071
This is bullshit. This is bullshit,
l'm not listening to this!

1701
01:50:05,158 --> 01:50:07,718
- You are insane!
- No. You're insane.

1702
01:50:07,798 --> 01:50:10,437
We simply do not have time for this crap.

1703
01:50:11,838 --> 01:50:13,954
lt's called a changeover.

1704
01:50:14,038 --> 01:50:16,029
The movie goes on...

1705
01:50:16,118 --> 01:50:19,110
..and nobody in the audience has any idea.

1706
01:50:31,558 --> 01:50:35,073
- Sir! Are you checking out?
- Yeah. Bill me.

1707
01:50:35,158 --> 01:50:37,467
Can you initial this list of phone calls?

1708
01:50:41,718 --> 01:50:45,597
- When were these made?
- Between 2.00 and 3.30 this morning.

1709
01:50:51,198 --> 01:50:55,157
Have l been going to bed earlier every night?
Have l been sleeping later?

1710
01:50:55,238 --> 01:50:59,914
Have l been Tyler longer and longer?

1711
01:51:02,318 --> 01:51:04,627
ls anybody here?

1712
01:51:07,198 --> 01:51:09,189
Deja vu all over again.

1713
01:51:10,798 --> 01:51:13,187
With enough soap,
one could blow up anything.

1714
01:51:15,438 --> 01:51:17,429
Oh, my God.

1715
01:51:19,078 --> 01:51:21,069
(ringing tone)

1716
01:51:21,158 --> 01:51:23,433
- (man) 1888.
- Who am l calling?

1717
01:51:23,838 --> 01:51:27,353
1888 Franklin. This is maintenance. Hello?

1718
01:51:28,478 --> 01:51:30,036
Hello?

1719
01:51:30,118 --> 01:51:32,109
1888 Franklin Street?

1720
01:51:32,198 --> 01:51:34,189
Yes. Can l help you?

1721
01:51:36,558 --> 01:51:39,026
- Hello?
- Yeah, yeah.

1722
01:51:39,118 --> 01:51:41,552
l need to talk to your supervisor right away.

1723
01:51:41,638 --> 01:51:43,629
- Speaking.
- OK, listen to me.

1724
01:51:43,718 --> 01:51:46,755
Something terrible
is about to happen to your building.

1725
01:51:46,838 --> 01:51:48,829
lt's under control, sir.

1726
01:51:49,278 --> 01:51:52,668
- Excuse me?
- Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.

1727
01:51:56,758 --> 01:51:58,032
(man) 2160.

1728
01:52:05,358 --> 01:52:07,747
Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!

1729
01:52:09,398 --> 01:52:12,071
Wait! l gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!

1730
01:52:12,158 --> 01:52:16,151
Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom!
They almost broke my arm!

1731
01:52:16,238 --> 01:52:18,877
They were burning their fingertips with lye.

1732
01:52:18,958 --> 01:52:22,746
This needs a tremendous act of faith
on your part, but hear me out.

1733
01:52:22,838 --> 01:52:26,626
- Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
- A little more faith than that.

1734
01:52:29,718 --> 01:52:32,186
l don't wanna hear
anything you have to say.

1735
01:52:32,278 --> 01:52:34,314
You have every right to be...

1736
01:52:34,878 --> 01:52:36,675
l'll just have a coffee, thanks.

1737
01:52:36,758 --> 01:52:39,591
Sir. Anything you order is free of charge, sir.

1738
01:52:39,678 --> 01:52:41,634
Why is it free of charge?

1739
01:52:41,718 --> 01:52:43,674
- (whispers) Don't ask.
- Whatever.

1740
01:52:43,758 --> 01:52:49,037
Er... l'll have the clam chowder, fried chicken
and baked potato and a chocolate chiffon pie.

1741
01:52:49,118 --> 01:52:51,109
Clean food, please.

1742
01:52:51,198 --> 01:52:54,110
ln that case,
may l advise against the clam chowder.

1743
01:52:54,198 --> 01:52:56,189
No clam chowder. Thank you.

1744
01:52:57,598 --> 01:52:59,748
(Marla) You got about 30 seconds.

1745
01:53:02,318 --> 01:53:04,752
l know l've been acting very strange, OK?

1746
01:53:04,838 --> 01:53:08,114
- l know it seems there's two sides to me...
- Two sides?

1747
01:53:08,198 --> 01:53:13,033
- You're Dr Jekyll and Mr Jackass.
- l know. But l realised something important.

1748
01:53:13,118 --> 01:53:17,031
- What?
- The nature of our relationship wasn't clear...

1749
01:53:17,118 --> 01:53:19,393
..to me for reasons l won't go into.

1750
01:53:19,478 --> 01:53:21,946
- l know l haven't treated you well.
- Whatever.

1751
01:53:22,038 --> 01:53:24,632
No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!

1752
01:53:24,718 --> 01:53:26,913
Fifteen seconds,
don't open your mouth.

1753
01:53:26,998 --> 01:53:28,989
l'm trying to tell you l'm sorry.

1754
01:53:29,078 --> 01:53:33,196
What l've come to realise
is that l really like you, Marla.

1755
01:53:33,278 --> 01:53:35,314
You do?

1756
01:53:35,398 --> 01:53:37,195
l really do.

1757
01:53:37,278 --> 01:53:41,430
l care about you and l don't want anything
bad to happen to you because of me.

1758
01:53:41,518 --> 01:53:44,157
Marla, your life is in danger.

1759
01:53:44,238 --> 01:53:46,069
What?

1760
01:53:46,158 --> 01:53:49,707
You need to leave town for a while.
Get out of any major city.

1761
01:53:49,798 --> 01:53:52,471
- Just go camping...
- You're an insane person.

1762
01:53:52,558 --> 01:53:55,868
- No. l've involved you in something terrible.
- No. Shut up!

1763
01:53:55,958 --> 01:53:58,392
- You're not safe.
- (yells) Shut up!

1764
01:54:00,118 --> 01:54:04,396
- Listen, l tried, Tyler. l really tried.
- l know you did.

1765
01:54:04,478 --> 01:54:07,390
There are things about you l like.
You're smart, funny.

1766
01:54:07,478 --> 01:54:09,355
You're spectacular in bed.

1767
01:54:09,438 --> 01:54:10,791
But...

1768
01:54:10,878 --> 01:54:12,869
..you're intolerable.

1769
01:54:12,958 --> 01:54:15,347
You have very serious emotional problems.

1770
01:54:15,438 --> 01:54:19,226
Deep-seated problems
for which you should seek professional help.

1771
01:54:19,318 --> 01:54:23,106
- l know, and l'm sorry.
- You're sorry, l'm sorry. Everyone's sorry.

1772
01:54:24,238 --> 01:54:26,229
l can't do this any more.

1773
01:54:26,318 --> 01:54:28,309
l can't.

1774
01:54:28,398 --> 01:54:30,389
And l won't.

1775
01:54:30,478 --> 01:54:32,434
l'm gone.

1776
01:54:32,518 --> 01:54:35,078
You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!

1777
01:54:37,798 --> 01:54:40,358
- Marla, you don't understand!
- Leave me alone!

1778
01:54:40,438 --> 01:54:42,872
- Marla, l am trying to protect you!
- Let go!

1779
01:54:42,958 --> 01:54:45,836
- l don't ever wanna see you again!
- That's fine...

1780
01:54:45,918 --> 01:54:47,909
Here, wait right here!

1781
01:54:51,678 --> 01:54:54,112
Hold it right there! Shut up!

1782
01:54:54,198 --> 01:54:56,234
Take this money and get on this bus.

1783
01:54:56,318 --> 01:54:58,388
l promise l won't bother you again.

1784
01:54:58,478 --> 01:54:59,877
Shut up!

1785
01:54:59,958 --> 01:55:03,030
Please get on the bus. Please get on the bus.

1786
01:55:04,158 --> 01:55:06,149
Why are you doing this?

1787
01:55:06,238 --> 01:55:10,151
They think you're a threat.
l can't explain it now, just trust me!

1788
01:55:10,238 --> 01:55:14,436
- lf l know where you are, you won't be safe.
- l'll keep this, it's asshole tax.

1789
01:55:14,518 --> 01:55:18,716
- Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities.
- Tyler.

1790
01:55:20,198 --> 01:55:22,917
You're the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

1791
01:55:37,318 --> 01:55:39,878
Hello. l need you to arrest me.

1792
01:55:39,958 --> 01:55:42,597
l am the leader of a terrorist organisation...

1793
01:55:42,678 --> 01:55:47,433
..responsible for numerous acts
of vandalism and assault all over this city.

1794
01:55:47,518 --> 01:55:51,227
ln the metropolitan area,
we had probably 200 members.

1795
01:55:51,318 --> 01:55:54,993
Chapters have sprung up
in five or six other major cities already.

1796
01:55:55,118 --> 01:55:58,030
This is a tightly-regimented organisation...

1797
01:55:58,118 --> 01:56:03,511
..with many cells capable of operating
independent of central leadership.

1798
01:56:03,598 --> 01:56:07,307
Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street.

1799
01:56:07,398 --> 01:56:09,229
That's our headquarters.

1800
01:56:09,318 --> 01:56:11,786
ln the back, buried in the garden,...

1801
01:56:11,878 --> 01:56:14,790
..you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.

1802
01:56:14,878 --> 01:56:18,075
ln the basement,
you're gonna find some bathtubs...

1803
01:56:18,158 --> 01:56:23,278
..that have been used very recently
to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.

1804
01:56:23,358 --> 01:56:25,314
l believe the plan is to blow up...

1805
01:56:25,398 --> 01:56:28,356
..the headquarters
of these credit card companies...

1806
01:56:28,438 --> 01:56:30,429
..and the TRW building.

1807
01:56:31,358 --> 01:56:34,555
Why these buildings?
Why credit card companies?

1808
01:56:34,638 --> 01:56:38,108
lf you erase the debt record,
then we all go back to zero.

1809
01:56:38,918 --> 01:56:40,909
You'll create total chaos.

1810
01:56:42,438 --> 01:56:45,555
Keep him talking. l need to make a phone call.

1811
01:56:55,678 --> 01:56:57,828
l really admire what you're doing.

1812
01:56:58,278 --> 01:57:00,269
What?

1813
01:57:00,358 --> 01:57:02,314
You're a brave man to order this.

1814
01:57:02,398 --> 01:57:04,116
You're a genius, sir.

1815
01:57:04,198 --> 01:57:08,749
You said if anyone ever interferes
with Project Mayhem, even you,...

1816
01:57:08,838 --> 01:57:11,068
..we gotta get his balls.

1817
01:57:12,438 --> 01:57:15,475
- Don't fight.
- lt's a powerful gesture, Mr Durden.

1818
01:57:15,558 --> 01:57:18,470
- lt will set an example.
- You're making a big mistake!

1819
01:57:18,558 --> 01:57:21,277
- You said you'd say that.
- l'm not Tyler Durden!

1820
01:57:21,358 --> 01:57:25,067
- You told us you'd say that too.
- All right. l am Tyler Durden.

1821
01:57:25,158 --> 01:57:27,752
Listen to me. l'm giving you a direct order.

1822
01:57:27,838 --> 01:57:31,831
- We're aborting this mission now.
- You said you would definitely say that.

1823
01:57:37,718 --> 01:57:41,108
Are you fucking out of your minds?
You're police officers!

1824
01:57:41,918 --> 01:57:43,909
ls somebody timing this?

1825
01:57:44,078 --> 01:57:46,911
- (knocking)
- Keep your mouth shut.

1826
01:57:46,998 --> 01:57:48,989
Shit!

1827
01:57:51,518 --> 01:57:54,191
- Some of this information checks out.
- Uh-huh.

1828
01:57:54,278 --> 01:57:57,429
- Let's go to that house on Paper Street.
- Be right there.

1829
01:57:58,118 --> 01:57:59,836
Hey, wait!

1830
01:58:00,478 --> 01:58:02,912
- l got him.
- Sir, we have to do this.

1831
01:58:02,998 --> 01:58:05,387
- Stop fighting!
- Where's the rubber band?

1832
01:58:05,478 --> 01:58:07,867
Get away from me! Drop that fucking knife!

1833
01:58:11,278 --> 01:58:14,554
Back up. Face down on the floor right now!

1834
01:58:15,758 --> 01:58:17,714
Get down on the floor!

1835
01:58:22,278 --> 01:58:25,031
The first person
that comes out of this door...

1836
01:58:25,118 --> 01:58:26,995
..gets a lead salad! Understand?

1837
01:58:46,478 --> 01:58:48,594
(car horn)

1838
01:58:50,358 --> 01:58:52,826
- (horn)
- Get away! Stay away!

1839
01:58:56,998 --> 01:58:58,875
(horns blare)

1840
01:59:05,238 --> 01:59:07,229
l ran.

1841
01:59:07,758 --> 01:59:11,751
l ran until my muscles burned
and my veins pumped battery acid.

1842
01:59:14,278 --> 01:59:16,269
Then l ran some more.

1843
01:59:55,278 --> 01:59:57,508
(tyyler) What the fuck are you doing?

1844
01:59:57,598 --> 02:00:00,431
Running around in your underpants!
You look crazy!

1845
02:00:00,518 --> 02:00:03,510
No. l'm onto you.
l know what's going on here.

1846
02:00:03,598 --> 02:00:08,308
Come on, then. l got us a great place
to watch from. lt'll be like pay-per-view.

1847
02:00:10,278 --> 02:00:12,314
(laughs)

1848
02:00:54,318 --> 02:00:56,878
- Oh, Christ.
- Now what are you doing?

1849
02:00:56,958 --> 02:01:00,189
- l'm stopping this.
- Why?

1850
02:01:00,278 --> 02:01:03,509
- The greatest thing you've ever done.
- l can't let this happen.

1851
02:01:03,598 --> 02:01:06,715
There are 10 other bombs
in 10 other buildings.

1852
02:01:06,798 --> 02:01:09,028
Since when is Project Mayhem
about murder?

1853
02:01:09,118 --> 02:01:11,029
The buildings are empty.

1854
02:01:11,118 --> 02:01:13,837
We're not killing anyone.
We're setting 'em free!

1855
02:01:13,918 --> 02:01:16,591
Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.

1856
02:01:16,678 --> 02:01:19,909
You wanna make an omelette,
you gotta break some eggs.

1857
02:01:19,998 --> 02:01:23,434
No. l'm not listening to you.
You're not even there.

1858
02:01:29,238 --> 02:01:33,436
l wouldn't do that.
Not unless you knew which wires were what.

1859
02:01:33,518 --> 02:01:35,156
lf you know, l know.

1860
02:01:40,558 --> 02:01:44,710
Or maybe l knew you'd know, so l spent
all day thinking about the wrong ones.

1861
02:01:52,918 --> 02:01:53,953
You think?

1862
02:01:55,878 --> 02:01:57,869
Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.

1863
02:01:58,718 --> 02:02:01,596
Pull any one but the green one.

1864
02:02:06,118 --> 02:02:08,632
l asked you not to do that!

1865
02:02:10,398 --> 02:02:11,911
(tyyler) Fuck!

1866
02:02:12,798 --> 02:02:14,834
Tyler, get away from the van.

1867
02:02:16,958 --> 02:02:20,189
Tyler, l'm not kidding!
Get away from the van!

1868
02:02:20,278 --> 02:02:21,597
Goddamn it!

1869
02:02:22,758 --> 02:02:25,147
Whoa! Whoa!

1870
02:02:27,678 --> 02:02:28,997
OK.

1871
02:02:29,078 --> 02:02:32,309
You are now firing a gun
at your imaginary friend...

1872
02:02:32,398 --> 02:02:34,866
..near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!

1873
02:02:36,998 --> 02:02:38,670
Cool it, Tyler!

1874
02:02:51,358 --> 02:02:53,349
Aw, come on!

1875
02:02:53,438 --> 02:02:55,394
Don't go!

1876
02:03:31,438 --> 02:03:32,587
What?!

1877
02:04:15,958 --> 02:04:17,676
(tyyler) Three minutes.

1878
02:04:17,758 --> 02:04:19,953
This is it.

1879
02:04:20,038 --> 02:04:21,994
The beginning.

1880
02:04:22,078 --> 02:04:23,955
Ground zero.

1881
02:04:24,038 --> 02:04:26,233
l think this is about where we came in.

1882
02:04:26,318 --> 02:04:28,673
Do you have a speech for the occasion?

1883
02:04:28,758 --> 02:04:31,670
- (mumbles)
- l'm sorry?

1884
02:04:31,758 --> 02:04:33,749
l still can't think of anything.

1885
02:04:35,718 --> 02:04:37,709
Ah. Flashback humour.

1886
02:04:42,598 --> 02:04:44,554
lt's getting exciting now.

1887
02:04:46,038 --> 02:04:47,756
Two and a half.

1888
02:04:47,838 --> 02:04:50,306
Think of everything we've accomplished.

1889
02:04:50,398 --> 02:04:54,994
Out these windows, we will view
the collapse of financial history.

1890
02:04:55,078 --> 02:04:58,627
One step closer to economic equilibrium.

1891
02:05:11,678 --> 02:05:13,953
Why is she here?

1892
02:05:14,038 --> 02:05:15,869
Tying up loose ends.

1893
02:05:15,958 --> 02:05:18,916
Put me down, you baldheaded fuck!

1894
02:05:18,998 --> 02:05:21,990
- l beg you, please don't do this.
- l'm not doing this.

1895
02:05:22,078 --> 02:05:25,388
- We are doing this. This is what we want.
- No.

1896
02:05:25,478 --> 02:05:29,994
- l don't want this.
- Right. Except you is meaningless now.

1897
02:05:30,078 --> 02:05:33,912
- We have to forget about you.
- You're a voice in my head.

1898
02:05:33,998 --> 02:05:35,989
You're a voice in mine!

1899
02:05:36,078 --> 02:05:38,797
- Why can't l get rid of you?
- You need me.

1900
02:05:38,878 --> 02:05:40,869
No. l don't. l really don't any more.

1901
02:05:40,958 --> 02:05:45,076
You created me. l didn't create some
loser alter ego to make me feel better.

1902
02:05:45,158 --> 02:05:48,946
- Take some responsibility.
- l do. l am responsible for all of it...

1903
02:05:49,078 --> 02:05:50,716
..and l accept that.

1904
02:05:50,798 --> 02:05:54,677
So, please, l'm begging you,
please call this off.

1905
02:05:56,598 --> 02:05:58,714
Have l ever let us down?

1906
02:06:00,078 --> 02:06:02,308
How far have you come because of me?!

1907
02:06:07,958 --> 02:06:09,949
l will bring us through this.

1908
02:06:10,038 --> 02:06:13,667
As always, l will carry you
kicking and screaming...

1909
02:06:13,758 --> 02:06:16,067
..and in the end you will thank me.

1910
02:06:16,558 --> 02:06:18,947
Tyler. Tyler.

1911
02:06:19,038 --> 02:06:22,428
l'm grateful to you.
For everything that you've done for me.

1912
02:06:22,518 --> 02:06:25,078
But this is too much. l don't want this.

1913
02:06:25,158 --> 02:06:30,232
What do you want? Your shit job back?
Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?

1914
02:06:30,318 --> 02:06:32,309
Fuck you! l won't do it.

1915
02:06:33,118 --> 02:06:36,793
- This can't be happening.
- lt's already done, so shut up!

1916
02:06:36,878 --> 02:06:38,436
60 seconds till CRl.

1917
02:06:38,958 --> 02:06:40,949
No.

1918
02:06:42,758 --> 02:06:45,431
l can figure this out. This isn't even real.

1919
02:06:45,518 --> 02:06:49,033
You're not real, that gun...
That gun isn't even in your hand.

1920
02:06:50,478 --> 02:06:52,469
The gun's in my hand.

1921
02:06:57,278 --> 02:06:59,633
Good for you. lt doesn't change a thing.

1922
02:07:08,158 --> 02:07:10,718
Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?

1923
02:07:10,798 --> 02:07:12,789
Not my head, Tyler.

1924
02:07:13,358 --> 02:07:15,314
Our head.

1925
02:07:16,758 --> 02:07:18,749
lnteresting.

1926
02:07:21,638 --> 02:07:24,198

Hey. lt's you and me.

1929

Tyler,...

1930
02:07:43,958 --> 02:07:46,233
..l want you to really listen to me.

1931
02:07:46,318 --> 02:07:48,673
OK.

1932
02:07:48,758 --> 02:07:50,749
My eyes are open.

1933
02:08:08,718 --> 02:08:10,674
What's that smell?

1934
02:08:23,118 --> 02:08:25,234

1935
02:08:26,998 --> 02:08:28,670

1941
02:08:49,518 --> 02:08:53,352

- No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.

1942
02:08:53,438 --> 02:08:56,077
- You look awful. You need assistance.

1943
02:08:56,198 --> 02:08:59,634
Look, l'm fine... Everything's fine.

- Leave her with me. Meet me downstairs.

02:09:16,158 --> 02:09:18,149
Yes, l'm sure.

1951
02:09:19,198 --> 02:09:23,157
You fucker! What kind of sick

Find some gauze.

1961
02:09:53,038 --> 02:09:54,994
You shot yourself?

1962
02:09:55,078 --> 02:09:57,638
Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me.

1963
02:09:57,718 --> 02:09:59,868
