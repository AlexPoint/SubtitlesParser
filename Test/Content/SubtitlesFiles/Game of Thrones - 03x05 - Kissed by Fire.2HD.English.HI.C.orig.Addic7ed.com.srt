[21][48]The Tyrells helped us|defeat Stannis Baratheon.
[48][62]You must see Highgarden.
[63][87]I don't think the queen would|let me leave King's Landing.
[87][106]Once I marry Joffrey,|I'll be queen.
[106][143]And if you were|to marry Loras...
[143][169]You must give yourself|to the Lord of Light.
[170][195]- I have a wife.|- She's shut away in a tower.
[195][227]And she's given you no sons,|only stillborns.
[227][265]I lost one son to the Kingslayer,|strangled with a chain.
[266][281]I grieve for|your sons, my lord.
[282][304]I don't want your grief.|I want my vengeance.
[341][372]Do that again and I'll|take your other hand.
[372][395]- What value was the mill?|- I seized an opportunity.
[395][427]<i>We took hostages-- Willem|Lannister, Martyn Lannister.</i>
[427][453]Willem and Martyn Lannister|are 14 years old.
[453][473]I'm not your enemy.
[474][507]- This woman is evil!|- Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.
[508][521]You want to assassinate a girl?
[521][551]- Based on whose information?|- Varys: <i>Ser Jorah Mormont.</i>
[551][574]He is serving as advisor|to the Targaryens.
[574][597]You bring us the whispers|of a traitor.
[598][620]Beric Dondarrion?|If you mean to murder me,
[621][638]then bloody well|get on with it.
[639][662]You'll die soon enough,|but it won't be murder.
[663][688]I sentence you|to trial by combat.
[705][730]- ( dragon screeching )|- Is it done, then?

[2022][2048]<i>( fire crackling )</i>
[2084][2135]Lord, cast your light upon us.
[2139][2161]Men:|Lord of Light, defend us.
[2191][2209]Show us the truth.
[2210][2233]Strike this man down|if he is guilty.
[2234][2258]Give strength to his sword|if he is true.
[2259][2300]<i>Lord of Light, give us wisdom.</i>
[2348][2373]For the night is dark
[2374][2388]and full of terrors.
[2389][2419]Men: For the night is|dark and full of terrors.
[2731][2752]( shouts )
[3152][3171]( screams )
[3236][3255]Get back.
[3526][3553]( men chanting )|Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
[3553][3580]Guilty. Guilty.|Guilty.
[3581][3608]Guilty.|Guilty. Guilty.
[3608][3637]Guilty. Guilty.|Guilty.
[3637][3652]Kill him!
[3652][3681]( chanting continues )
[3700][3718]( shouts )
[3740][3761]( chanting stops )
[3839][3859]Lord, cast your light|upon this man, your servant.
[3859][3877]Bring him back|from death and darkness.
[3878][3890]His flame has been|extinguished.
[3891][3908]- Restore it.|- ( shouting )
[3908][3924]Thoros: <i>For the night is|dark and full of terrors.</i>
[3924][3946]- <i>Lord, cast...</i>|- Arya, don't!
[3947][3971]Bring him back|from death and darkness...
[3971][3989]No!
[3989][4020]Let go of me!|Let me go!
[4020][4051]Looks like their god likes me|more than your butcher's boy.
[4051][4067]Burn in hell!
[4068][4087]Beric:|<i>He will.</i>
[4123][4153]But not today.
[4385][4420]Orell says there are crows|patrolling on the Wall.
[4421][4446]Tell me what you know.
[4447][4464]There are four|to a patrol--
[4464][4483]two builders to check|for structural damage,
[4483][4498]two rangers to watch|for enemies.
[4498][4519]How often do these|patrols go out?
[4532][4548]It varies.
[4548][4575]If I knew where on the Wall we|were heading, I could tell you.
[4575][4600]You'd like to know that.
[4618][4645]There are 19 castles|guarding the Wall.
[4659][4683]How many are manned?
[4683][4707]Three.
[4707][4734]You sure of that?
[4751][4767]Which three?
[4794][4808]Castle Black.
[4809][4827]Aye, Castle Black.
[4827][4848]Everyone knows Castle Black.
[4849][4869]Which others?
[4921][4945]Eastwatch-by-the-Sea
[4945][4974]and the Shadow Tower.
[4995][5016]How many men remain|in Castle Black?
[5017][5034]- 1,000.|- Liar.
[5055][5076]What happens to your eagle|after I kill you?
[5076][5102]Does he drift away like a|kite with his strings cut
[5102][5125]or does he just flop|dead to the ground?
[5125][5140]He's no crow.
[5141][5164]Just 'cause you want him inside|you don't make him one of us.
[5165][5190]I'm not afraid of you.
[5252][5271]I like you, boy.
[5272][5301]But if you lie to me,
[5301][5333]I'll pull your guts out|through your throat.
[5357][5379]1,000 men.
[5429][5458]We'll find out soon enough.
[5527][5543]I don't need you to protect me.
[5544][5558]Of course you do.
[5558][5586]Who stopped Rattleshirt when he|was about to cut your throat?
[5587][5615]Who vouched for you with Mance?
[5615][5635]It seems you owe me a debt.
[5649][5674]- Give it back.|- Well, I stole it.
[5674][5711]It's mine. If you want|it, come steal it back.
[5732][5750]<i>Ygritte!</i>
[5760][5781]<i>Ygritte!</i>
[5817][5843]Ygritte!|Seven hells.
[5844][5865]<i>Ygritte!</i>
[5900][5924]Is Orell right?
[5924][5944]Are you still a crow?
[5958][5992]It's time you proved yourself.
[5992][6009]Ygritte.
[6010][6036]You swore some vows.
[6036][6055]I want you to break 'em.
[6084][6108]I want you to see me.
[6133][6156]All of me.
[6293][6311]We shouldn't.
[6335][6353]We should.
[6515][6541]( breathing heavily )
[6551][6573]Why are you still dressed?
[6573][6598]You know nothing,|Jon Sno--
[6610][6633]( moaning )
[6750][6769]That thing you did
[6769][6789]with your mouth--
[6804][6833]is that what lords do to|their ladies in the South?
[6833][6854]I don't know.
[6855][6872]I just wanted to kiss|you there is all.
[6873][6887]Hmm.
[6888][6905]You seemed to like it.
[6905][6929]Aye, I liked it some.
[6929][6945]Who taught you that?
[6945][6974]There's been no one else.|Only you.
[6974][6993]A maid.
[6994][7012]You were a maid.
[7012][7041]I was a man|of the Night's Watch.
[7059][7081]How about you?|Were you a maid?
[7081][7095]What do you think?
[7096][7124]- Who was he?|- Just a boy.
[7125][7151]He came trading|with his brothers.
[7151][7183]He had red hair like me.|Kissed by fire.
[7183][7202]But...
[7203][7227]he was weak.
[7228][7245]Not like you.
[7245][7264]That was the first one.
[7265][7284]Then there was this Thenn boy.
[7285][7319]Spoke no Common, but gods,|he was built like a mammoth.
[7319][7351]Yeah, thanks.|I think I've heard enough.
[7379][7398]We'd best get back.
[7398][7422]Tormund--
[7445][7465]I'm not done with you yet.
[7535][7559]How long's it been|since you had a bath?
[7716][7736]Let's not go back.
[7749][7775]Let's stay here a while longer.
[7799][7832]I don't ever want to leave|this cave, Jon Snow.
[7853][7873]Not ever.
[7977][7994]Hound:|<i>I want my gold.</i>
[7994][8008]Thoros: It says it clearly|right there on that note
[8009][8024]you'll be repaid in full|when the war is over.
[8025][8048]Piss on that!|You're nothing but thieves.
[8049][8071]We're outlaws.|Outlaws steal.
[8071][8086]You're lucky|we didn't kill you.
[8086][8096]Come try it, archer.
[8096][8112]I'll shove those arrows|up your ass.
[8113][8138]You can't let him go. He's a murderer.|He's guilty.
[8138][8160]- Not in the eyes of god.|- You can't!
[8160][8192]Enough! The judgment|isn't ours to make.
[8217][8250]Go in peace, Sandor Clegane.
[8250][8268]The Lord of Light|isn't done with you yet.
[8318][8347]Man:|<i>Riders coming through!</i>
[8348][8379]( horses neighing )
[8454][8469]The Kingslayer.
[8469][8480]Down!
[8480][8502]On your knees.
[8502][8533]Lord Bolton, I give you|the Kingslayer.
[8533][8550]( groans )
[8550][8569]Pick him up, Locke.
[8635][8650]You've lost a hand.
[8650][8678]No, my lord, he has it here.
[8713][8733]- Take this away.|- Send it to his father?
[8733][8754]You'll hold your tongue|unless you want to lose it.
[8765][8791]Cut her free.|Apologies, my lady.
[8792][8812]You're under my protection now.
[8812][8839]Thank you, my lord.
[8871][8892]Find suitable rooms|for our guests.
[8892][8919]We'll speak later.
[8936][8951]Lord Bolton.
[8989][9009]Is there word from the capital?
[9022][9038]You haven't heard?
[9053][9079]Stannis Baratheon laid siege|to King's Landing.
[9080][9104]<i>Sailed into Blackwater Bay.</i>
[9104][9137]<i>Stormed the gates</i>|<i>with thousands of men.</i>
[9150][9167]And your sister...
[9221][9242]How can I put this?
[9264][9281]Your sister...
[9295][9316]is alive and well.
[9317][9345]Your father's forces prevailed.
[9362][9381]Ser Jaime isn't well.
[9381][9406]Take him to Qyburn.
[9532][9555]( winces )
[9556][9577]( groans )
[9595][9624]- Will I die?|- No.
[9624][9638]The corruption has spread.
[9638][9658]I fear it must be cut away.
[9659][9689]The safest course would be|to take the whole arm off.
[9690][9714]Then you'll die.
[9730][9754]You're no maester.
[9755][9782]Where's your chain?
[9782][9803]The Citadel stripped me of it.
[9803][9836]They found some|of my experiments
[9836][9856]too bold.
[9856][9892]I can leave your upper arm,|make the cut at your elbow.
[9893][9930]I don't need my right hand|to kill you.
[9941][9965]I can take away|the rotting flesh
[9965][9992]and try and burn out|the corruption
[9992][10015]- with boiling wine.|- Mmm.
[10015][10037]With any luck,|that will suffice.
[10038][10063]You'll need milk of the poppy.
[10076][10096]- No milk of the poppy.|- There will be pain.
[10096][10128]- I'll scream.|- Quite a bit of pain.
[10128][10149]I'll scream loudly.
[10235][10264]( groans )
[10264][10287]<i>( scissors snipping )</i>
[10300][10313]( groans )
[10313][10335]( breathing heavily )
[10430][10455]( screams )
[10496][10513]Lord Baelish.
[10513][10529]Your Grace.
[10530][10549]I wonder if I might|ask you for a favor.
[10550][10564]Of course, Your Grace.
[10564][10578]I have reason to believe|that House Tyrell
[10578][10599]do not hold the crown's|best interests at heart.
[10599][10644]I see. And have you shared these|suspicions with Lord Tywin?
[10644][10673]My father's a practical man.|He appreciates facts.
[10674][10701]Myself, I often|find them a hindrance.
[10701][10732]And he appreciates those who aid|his family, as you well know.
[10732][10748]He's almost as generous|to those who help us
[10748][10780]as he is unpleasant|towards those who don't.
[10780][10805]You have a good working|relationship with the Tyrells.
[10805][10834]I thought you might look into it|before you leave the capital.
[10835][10856]- I shall do my best.|- Thank you.
[10857][10891]And your best will prove better than|when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?
[10892][10909]I assure you that it will.
[10962][10982]<i>( liquid pouring )</i>
[10982][11005]Gods, boy, that's enough.|We're not in a tavern.
[11006][11020]- Pardon, my lady.|- No need to speak.
[11020][11042]Are there any figs?|Fetch some.
[11043][11064]I always take figs|midafternoon.
[11064][11079]They help move the bowels.
[11079][11100]To what do I owe this summons?
[11100][11120]Thank you for seeing me,|my lady.
[11121][11143]I had hoped we might discuss|a few financial matters.
[11143][11181]I climbed all those steps to|discuss financial matters?
[11181][11194]It's the royal wedding.
[11194][11208]I'm told you had a hand|in planning it.
[11209][11220]Naturally.
[11221][11245]It's shaping up to be|a very involved affair.
[11246][11267]The word extravagant|has been used.
[11267][11284]What good|is the word extravagant
[11284][11308]if it can't be used|to describe a royal wedding?
[11308][11329]- I understand that.|- Good.
[11329][11354]But, as Master of Coin,|it falls upon me
[11354][11371]to calculate the cost|for the crown.
[11371][11396]As of now, it's a huge expense.
[11397][11408]And?
[11408][11445]And we're at war, Lady Olenna.
[11445][11469]Oh, I'd nearly forgotten.
[11469][11483]Yes, and maintaining|supply lines--
[11483][11501]<i>I can't think</i>|<i>how it slipped my mind.</i>
[11501][11527]What is it, 12,000 infantrymen
[11527][11545]<i>the Tyrell family has supplied?</i>
[11546][11568]1,800 mounted lances.
[11569][11588]<i>2,000 in support.</i>
[11589][11620]Provisions so this city|might survive the winter.
[11620][11637]<i>A million bushels of wheat.</i>
[11637][11673]Half a million bushels each|of barley, oats, and rye.
[11673][11691]<i>20,000 head of cattle.</i>
[11691][11707]<i>50,000 sheep.</i>
[11707][11732]You don't have to lecture me|about wartime expenses.
[11732][11752]I'm quite familiar with them.
[11753][11769]And we are so grateful|for your contributions
[11770][11795]which are necessary for the|preservation of the realm.
[11796][11814]As is a royal wedding.
[11814][11840]The people are hungry|for more than just food.
[11840][11855]They crave distractions.
[11855][11888]And if we don't provide them,|they'll create their own.
[11888][11914]And their distractions|are likely to end
[11915][11937]with us being torn to pieces.
[11938][11961]<i>A royal wedding is much safer.</i>
[11961][11992]- Wouldn't you say?|- I would.
[11992][12014]<i>And traditionally paid for</i>
[12014][12035]- by the royal family.|- <i>( door opens )</i>
[12048][12072]I was told you were|drunk, impertinent,
[12072][12092]and thoroughly debauched.
[12092][12108]You can imagine|my disappointment
[12108][12138]at finding nothing but a|browbeaten bookkeeper.
[12157][12183]Where did you go|for them, Volantis?
[12194][12212]- My lady--|- Oh, very well.
[12212][12232]I won't have it said|that House Tyrell
[12233][12250]refuses to play its part.
[12250][12265]We'll pay for half the expenses
[12266][12292]and the celebrations|will go on as planned.
[12292][12310]- Is that sufficient?|- Quite sufficient. Thank you.
[12311][12334]Very good, then. That's settled.|Good day.
[12365][12386]Give me that.
[12434][12452]Arya:|<i>What are you doing?</i>
[12463][12483]Just mending|Lord Beric's armor.
[12484][12506]Why?
[12506][12530]I'm going to stay on|and smith for the Brotherhood.
[12530][12549]Have you lost your mind?
[12549][12584]When the Lannisters find this place,|you think they'll spare the smiths?
[12585][12601]They'll cave your head in|with your own helmet.
[12601][12629]The Lannisters wanted to kill me long|before I joined the Brotherhood.
[12629][12648]You don't have to do this.
[12649][12667]I want to.
[12667][12682]They need good men.
[12682][12715]Robb needs good men, too.|We're leaving tomorrow.
[12715][12739]- And then you--|- What? Serve him?
[12750][12780]I've served men my entire life.
[12780][12798]I served Master Mott|at King's Landing
[12798][12824]and he sold me to the Watch.
[12825][12841]I served Lord Tywin|at Harrenhal,
[12841][12870]wondering every day if I'd|get tortured or killed.
[12882][12895]I'm done serving.
[12895][12918]You just said you were|serving Lord Beric.
[12931][12966]He may be their leader,|but they chose him.
[12967][12998]These men are brothers.|They're a family.
[13016][13034]I've never had a family.
[13064][13081]I can be your family.
[13112][13140]You wouldn't be my family.
[13140][13156]You'd be "my lady."
[13295][13325]- <i>( men shouting )</i>|- <i>( swords clanging )</i>
[13345][13363]Willem.
[13363][13388]<i>( sounds get closer )</i>
[13389][13405]Willem!
[13435][13468]- Is this a rescue?|- Lannister filth! Take him!
[13469][13492]Please, I didn't do anything.|I'm just a squire.
[13493][13511]- Please--|- <i>( squelches )</i>
[13638][13653]Bring them in.
[13817][13833]Is that all of them?
[13855][13886]It took five of you to|murder two unarmed squires?
[13886][13905]Not murder, Your Grace.
[13906][13921]Vengeance.
[13921][13946]Vengeance?
[13947][13970]Those boys didn't|kill your sons.
[13971][14002]I saw Harrion die on the|battlefield and Torrhen--
[14002][14022]Was strangled|by the Kingslayer.
[14022][14045]- They were his kin.|- They were boys!
[14067][14084]Look at them.
[14102][14119]Tell your mother|to look at them.
[14119][14142]<i>She killed them as much as I.</i>
[14142][14169]My mother had nothing|to do with this.
[14169][14187]This was your treason.
[14188][14212]It's treason|to free your enemies.
[14212][14233]In war, you kill your enemies.
[14234][14255]Did your father|not teach you that, boy?
[14255][14275]- ( grunts )|- Leave him.
[14317][14333]Aye.
[14333][14357]Leave me to the king.
[14357][14394]He wants to give me a scolding|before he sets me free.
[14405][14439]That's how he deals|with treason.
[14439][14462]Our King in the North.
[14462][14486]Or should I call him
[14486][14517]the King Who Lost the North?
[14545][14570]Escort Lord Karstark|to the dungeon.
[14570][14587]Hang the rest.
[14588][14602]Mercy, sire!|I didn't kill anyone.
[14603][14617]I only watched for the guards.
[14618][14639]This one was only the watcher.
[14639][14660]Hang him last so he can|watch the others die.
[14660][14681]Man: <i>Please! Please, no.|They made me do it!</i>
[14682][14721]They made me!|They made me!
[14802][14826]Word of this|can't leave Riverrun.
[14827][14845]They were Tywin|Lannister's nephews.
[14846][14863]The Lannisters pay their debts.
[14863][14877]<i>They never stop</i>|<i>talking about it.</i>
[14877][14897]Would you make me a liar|as well as a murderer?
[14897][14914]It wouldn't be lying.
[14915][14937]We will bury them|and remain silent
[14937][14951]<i>until the war is done.</i>
[14951][14965]I'm not fighting for justice
[14966][14994]if I don't serve justice|to murderers in my ranks,
[14995][15024]<i>no matter how highborn.</i>
[15025][15050]He has to die.
[15051][15078]The Karstarks are Northmen.
[15078][15101]They won't forgive|the killing of their lord.
[15102][15121]Your mother's right.
[15122][15149]If you do this, the|Karstarks will abandon you.
[15150][15170]You tended to their wounds.
[15171][15198]You brought them supper.|Now they're dead.
[15198][15236]And more boys will keep dying|until this war is over.
[15237][15258]<i>You need Karstark men</i>|<i>to end it.</i>
[15258][15283]Spare his life.|Keep him as a hostage.
[15283][15304]A hostage.
[15304][15337]<i>Tell the Karstarks that as|long as they remain loyal,</i>
[15338][15358]he will not be harmed.
[15445][15474]<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>
[15608][15641]The blood of the First Men|flows through my veins
[15641][15672]as much as yours, boy.
[15672][15699]I fought the Mad King|for your father.
[15699][15735]I fought Joffrey for you.
[15736][15750]We are kin--
[15751][15774]Stark and Karstark.
[15774][15798]That didn't stop you|from betraying me.
[15798][15814]And it won't save you now.
[15814][15843]I don't want it to save me.
[15843][15880]I want it to haunt you|to the end of your days.
[15889][15906]Kneel, my lord.
[15996][16021]Rickard Karstark,
[16022][16037]<i>Lord of Karhold,</i>
[16038][16073]here in sight of gods and|men, I sentence you to die.
[16073][16102]Would you speak a final word?
[16113][16139]Kill me and be cursed.
[16139][16170]You are no king of mine.
[16311][16336]Arya:|<i>Joffrey.</i>
[16337][16357]Cersei.
[16373][16393]Ilyn Payne.
[16409][16429]Ser Meryn.
[16460][16481]The Hound.
[16516][16535]What are you|going to do with me?
[16536][16562]At first light|we'll ride for Riverrun.
[16562][16581]Your brother's there now.
[16581][16606]He'll make a contribution|to our cause
[16606][16623]and you can go home.
[16623][16651]I'm a hostage|and you're selling me.
[16651][16665]Don't think of it that way.
[16666][16692]- But it is that way.|- <i>It is.</i>
[16693][16721]- And it isn't.|- More is than isn't.
[16741][16772]Beric admired your father|a great deal, you know.
[16773][16794]He wanted to refuse|your ransom altogether.
[16794][16829]- So why don't you?|- We need the gold.
[16951][16967]Do I frighten you, child?
[16968][16986]No.
[17014][17032]You're angry with me.
[17032][17048]And I don't blame you.
[17049][17064]But letting him go|was the right thing.
[17064][17090]I have more reason than most|to want him hanged.
[17090][17115]- I thought he killed you.|- He did.
[17115][17134]But how...?
[17134][17156]Thoros...
[17156][17175]how many times|have you brought me back?
[17175][17210]It's the Lord of Light|brings you back.
[17210][17232]I'm just the lucky drunk|who says the words.
[17233][17259]- How many times?|- <i>Five, I think.</i>
[17259][17281]<i>No, this makes six.</i>
[17281][17294]Six.
[17295][17325]There was the first time--|the Mountain.
[17325][17340]<i>Show her.</i>
[17341][17378]Lance right through the chest.
[17379][17403]Then I was stabbed|in the belly.
[17403][17417]Then it was an arrow|in the back.
[17417][17445]<i>And that axe in the side.</i>
[17445][17478]Then the Lannisters caught me|and executed me for treason.
[17494][17517]Was it a hanging|or a dagger in the eye?
[17518][17549]Both.|Fuckers couldn't decide.
[17549][17575]<i>And the Hound makes six.</i>
[17575][17596]Second time I've been|killed by a Clegane.
[17597][17617]Thoros:|<i>You'd think you'd learn.</i>
[17634][17659]It's not getting|any easier, you know.
[17660][17680]Beric:|<i>I know.</i>
[17680][17701]<i>Every time I come back,</i>
[17701][17722]I'm a bit less.
[17738][17762]Pieces of you get chipped away.
[17777][17800]Could you bring back|a man without a head?
[17820][17856]Not six times.|Just once.
[17856][17885]I don't think it works|that way, child.
[17935][17971]He was a good man, Ned Stark.
[17972][18011]<i>He's at rest now, somewhere.</i>
[18011][18035]I would never wish|my life upon him.
[18035][18057]I would.
[18080][18101]You're alive.
[18151][18181]Lord, cast your light upon me.
[18191][18225]Protect me in the darkness.
[18225][18260]Burn away my sins.
[18260][18293]Help me serve you.
[18293][18315]Use me as you will.
[18340][18366]For the night is dark
[18366][18391]and full of terrors.
[18391][18411]<i>( door opens )</i>
[18502][18531]I have prayed day and night|for you to come to me.
[18547][18568]My lady.
[18568][18596]I meant to come sooner.
[18597][18629]- The battle--|- I know of your troubles, my king.
[18630][18657]The Lady Melisandre|has told me everything.
[18657][18682]Yes, of course.
[18775][18807]You mustn't despair.|Your claim is true.
[18808][18835]- You will be victorious.|- I believed that once.
[18836][18870]You are the one god's champion
[18870][18893]and the finest man|I've ever known.
[18893][18918]Selyse.
[18931][18956]I've broken a sacred vow.
[18991][19005]I've sinned.
[19005][19036]- No.|- I've wronged you.
[19037][19073]- I have shamed you.|- You're doing god's work.
[19073][19094]You don't understand.
[19150][19171]The Red Woman--
[19187][19205]the Lady Melisandre--
[19206][19225]I know, Stannis.
[19226][19266]The Lady Melisandre|has told me everything.
[19267][19299]No act done in service|of the Lord of Light
[19299][19327]can ever be a sin.
[19327][19360]When she told me,
[19360][19402]I wept with joy.
[19507][19544]Oh, my sweet boys.
[19559][19596]<i>Petyr, Tommard,</i>
[19596][19616]<i>Edric.</i>
[19627][19664]I thank god every day
[19665][19695]<i>for bringing Melisandre to us.</i>
[19695][19719]She gave you a son.
[19732][19758]I gave you...
[19770][19794]- <i>nothing.</i>|- That's not true.
[19843][19869]So you've come|to see her as well?
[19893][19913]There is no need.
[19927][19952]You must keep away|from such distractions.
[19953][19970]She's my daughter.
[19992][20006]I want to see her.
[20033][20059]You are a king.

[20466][20501]Mother said you fought|in a battle.
[20501][20517]Did you win?
[20530][20550]No.
[20550][20575]Did the Onion Knight|come back with you?
[20588][20609]He did.
[20610][20627]He fought bravely.
[20627][20644]He hasn't come to visit me.
[20644][20674]He said he'd bring me back a|present from the capital.
[20675][20691]He won't be visiting, child.
[20692][20717]Why not?|He's my friend.
[20717][20733]Look.
[20733][20758]<i>( drawer opens )</i>
[20804][20825]He made this for me.
[20825][20849]But don't tell Mother|I have it.
[20849][20868]It's a secret.
[20869][20895]Mother doesn't like|the Onion Knight.
[20917][20940]Ser Davos is a traitor.
[20960][20993]He's rotting in a dungeon|cell for his crime.

[21252][21267]What are you doing here?
[21267][21280]I need a bath.
[21281][21307]Help me out of these rags.
[21377][21402]Now get out.
[21526][21542]There's another tub.
[21543][21572]This one suits me fine.
[21699][21727]Don't worry.|I'm not interested.
[21727][21748]( exhales )
[21748][21781]<i>If I faint, pull me out.</i>
[21781][21812]I don't intend to be the first|Lannister to die in a bathtub.
[21812][21830]Why should I care how you die?
[21830][21860]You swore a solemn vow,|remember?
[21860][21897]You're supposed to get me to|King's Landing in one piece.
[21907][21932]Not going so well, is it?
[21932][21958]No wonder Renly died|with you guarding him.
[22056][22080]That was unworthy.|Forgive me.
[22080][22100]You protected me|better than most--
[22100][22127]- Don't you mock me.|- I'm apologizing.
[22145][22166]I'm sick of fighting.
[22166][22181]<i>Let's call a truce.</i>
[22181][22199]You need trust to have a truce.
[22213][22236]I trust you.
[22304][22335]<i>There it is.</i>|<i>There's the look.</i>
[22335][22360]I've seen it for 17 years
[22360][22377]on face after face.
[22377][22409]<i>You all despise me.</i>
[22410][22427]Kingslayer.
[22427][22449]Oathbreaker.
[22449][22478]A man without honor.
[22535][22550]You've heard of wildfire?
[22551][22566]Of course.
[22566][22594]<i>The Mad King</i>|<i>was obsessed with it.</i>
[22594][22619]He loved to watch people burn,
[22620][22645]the way their skin|blackened and blistered
[22645][22671]<i>and melted off their bones.</i>
[22672][22693]<i>He burned lords he didn't like.</i>
[22694][22714]<i>He burned Hands</i>|<i>who disobeyed him.</i>
[22715][22749]He burned anyone|who was against him.
[22763][22796]Before long, half the|country was against him.
[22824][22850]Aerys saw traitors everywhere.
[22865][22906]So he had his pyromancer|place caches of wildfire
[22906][22930]<i>all over the city--</i>
[22931][22953]beneath the Sept of Baelor
[22954][22971]and the slums of Flea Bottom.
[22972][23005]Under houses, stables, taverns.
[23005][23038]Even beneath|the Red Keep itself.
[23056][23080]Finally,
[23080][23112]the day of reckoning came.
[23113][23136]Robert Baratheon|marched on the capital
[23137][23157]after his victory|at the Trident.
[23158][23182]But my father arrived first
[23182][23209]with the whole Lannister|army at his back,
[23210][23254]promising to defend the city|against the rebels.
[23272][23293]I knew my father|better than that.
[23293][23327]<i>He's never been one</i>|<i>to pick the losing side.</i>
[23327][23353]<i>I told the Mad King as much.</i>
[23353][23390]I urged him|to surrender peacefully.
[23391][23423]<i>But the king didn't</i>|<i>listen to me.</i>
[23423][23450]He didn't listen to Varys|who tried to warn him.
[23450][23494]But he did listen|to Grand Maester Pycelle,
[23494][23521]that grey, sunken cunt.
[23535][23564]"You can trust|the Lannisters," he said.
[23581][23603]"The Lannisters|have always been
[23604][23626]true friends|of the crown."
[23648][23675]So we opened the gates
[23675][23697]and my father sacked the city.
[23698][23732]<i>Once again, I came to the king,</i>
[23732][23764]begging him to surrender.
[23800][23825]He told me to...
[23825][23850]bring him my father's head.
[23864][23884]Then he...
[23885][23915]turned to his pyromancer.
[23915][23943]"Burn them all," he said.
[23953][23984]"Burn them in their homes.
[23984][24005]Burn them|in their beds."
[24019][24067]Tell me, if your precious Renly
[24067][24096]commanded you to kill|your own father
[24096][24126]and stand by while|thousands of men,
[24127][24149]women, and children|burned alive,
[24149][24176]would you have done it?
[24177][24195]Would you have|kept your oath then?
[24235][24271]First, I killed the pyromancer.
[24271][24307]<i>And then when the king</i>|<i>turned to flee,</i>
[24307][24342]I drove my sword into his back.
[24355][24380]<i>"Burn them all,"</i>|<i>he kept saying.</i>
[24380][24400]"Burn them all."
[24400][24422]I don't think|he expected to die.
[24423][24452]He-- he meant to...
[24467][24492]burn with the rest of us
[24493][24521]and rise again,
[24521][24540]reborn as a dragon
[24540][24559]to turn his enemies to ash.
[24597][24633]I slit his throat to make sure|that didn't happen.
[24674][24711]That's where Ned Stark|found me.
[24712][24734]If this is true...
[24750][24769]why didn't you tell anyone?
[24789][24807]Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?
[24808][24823]Stark?
[24823][24848]You think
[24848][24888]the honorable Ned Stark
[24888][24921]wanted to hear my side?
[24921][24948]He judged me guilty
[24948][24972]the moment he set eyes on me.

[25890][25910]( laughs )
[25952][25969]I wouldn't know where to start.
[25970][25987]At the beginning.

[26457][26470]listening to the words.
[26470][26507]"In the name of the Warrior,|I charge you to be brave."
[26508][26537]All I could think of|was how badly I had to piss.
[26537][26550]( laughs )
[26550][26576]Jorah: In full plate|metal for 16 hours.
[26577][26596]Never occurred to me|till the fighting was over.
[26597][26629]I was very nearly the first man|knighted to piss on the king's boots.
[26629][26647]( laughs )
[26647][26669]Robert would have laughed.
[26670][26696]He was a good man,|a great warrior.
[26714][26733]And a terrible king.
[26734][26767]I burned away my years|fighting for terrible kings.
[26768][26783]- You swore an oath.|- Yes.
[26783][26802]And a man of honor|keeps his vows,
[26802][26837]even if he's serving|a drunk or a lunatic.
[26837][26863]Just once in my life|before it's over,
[26863][26893]I want to know what it's|like to serve with pride,
[26894][26925]to fight for someone|I believe in.
[26925][26943]Do you believe in her?
[26971][26990]With all my heart.
[27041][27052]These are the ones?
[27054][27075]Yes, khaleesi.|The officers.

[28044][28057]Of course he wanted her dead.
[28058][28094]She's a Targaryen.|The last Targaryen.
[28094][28121]I suppose no one on the small|council could speak sense to him.
[28122][28151]- I didn't sit on the small council.|- No?
[28151][28177]Doesn't the Lord Commander of|the Kingsguard traditionally--
[28178][28196]Traditionally, yes,|but I killed a dozen
[28197][28218]of Robert's friends|during his rebellion.
[28240][28256]He didn't want advice|on how to govern
[28257][28276]from a man who had fought|for the Mad King.
[28276][28295]Can't say I minded much.
[28297][28327]I always hated the politics.
[28328][28347]Yeah, I imagine I would, too.
[28347][28372]Hours spent jabbering|about backstabbings
[28372][28404]- and betrayals the world over.|- Mm-hmm.
[28435][28454]Still, she'll have|to wade through that muck
[28455][28477]if she wants to rule|the Seven Kingdoms.
[28477][28498]She'll have good men|around her to advise her,
[28498][28513]men with experience.
[28513][28528]Which men do you have in mind?
[28529][28549]Forgive me, Ser Jorah,|for what I'm about to say,
[28549][28585]but your reputation in Westeros|has suffered over the years.
[28585][28609]It suffered for a reason.
[28609][28627]I sold men into slavery.
[28627][28646]I don't know if your|presence by her side
[28646][28669]will help our cause|when we go home.
[28669][28687]Our cause?
[28687][28708]Forgive me, Ser|Barristan, but I was busy
[28708][28730]defending the khaleesi against|King Robert's assassins
[28730][28748]while you were still|bowing to the man.
[28749][28779]We both want her to rule.|Am I wrong?
[28779][28805]You only joined us|a few days ago.
[28806][28827]I can't speak|to your intentions.
[28827][28849]If we're truly|her loyal servants,
[28849][28877]we will do whatever|needs to be done,
[28877][28903]no matter the cost,|no matter our pride.
[28904][28929]You're not Lord Commander here.
[28930][28955]You're just another exile.
[28956][28976]And I take my orders|from the queen.
[29058][29086]- Talisa: <i>Come to bed.</i>|- You were right.
[29098][29116]The Karstarks are gone.
[29126][29148]Almost half our forces.
[29149][29184]Tywin Lannister knows what he|needs to do to make us unravel.
[29184][29213]Nothing.
[29213][29234]Only wait.
[29235][29260]Don't let him.
[29260][29281]What can I do?
[29281][29296]Attack King's Landing?
[29296][29317]There's nothing|he'd like better.
[29318][29338]He'd crush us in a day.
[29348][29359]We could ride north.
[29360][29386]<i>Take your land back</i>|<i>from the Greyjoys.</i>
[29387][29419]- Wait out the winter.|- Winter could last five years.
[29420][29433]Once my bannermen|are home again,
[29434][29461]sitting by the fire,|surrounded by their families,
[29462][29493]warm and safe, they'll|never ride south again.
[29493][29514]When I gathered|my lords together,
[29515][29534]we had a purpose, a mission.
[29534][29562]Now we're like a band|of bickering children.
[29585][29604]Give them a new purpose.
[29605][29622]What?
[29637][29659]Oh, I don't know.
[29659][29684]I don't even know|where Winterfell is.
[29711][29730]Here.
[29762][29798]And we're here.|King's Landing--
[29867][29882]What is it?
[29915][29946]I can't force them|to meet us in the field
[29947][29971]and I can't attack them|where they're strongest,
[29971][30000]but I can attack them|where they're not.
[30012][30040]And Casterly Rock|can't run away.
[30053][30083]I'm going to take|their home away from them.
[30096][30118]Can you do it?
[30118][30148]I need men to replace the|Karstarks who marched home.
[30149][30175]There is only one person|in this kingdom
[30175][30207]with that kind of army who hasn't|already sided with the Lannisters.
[30221][30248]The man whose daughter|I was supposed to marry--
[30259][30278]Walder Frey.
[30366][30389]He's such a splendid fighter.
[30389][30423]Do you have any idea|when we might...
[30423][30459]I'll plant the seed as soon|as Joffrey and I are married.
[30460][30475]It should grow quickly.
[30475][30491]Joffrey won't let me leave.
[30492][30519]He's got too many reasons|to keep me here.
[30519][30553]And only one to let you go.
[30553][30575]Because it will please me.
[30575][30596]Man:|<i>Squire!</i>
[30631][30648]Well fought, ser.
[30648][30676]That was no fight.|I don't know you.
[30676][30700]Olyver, if it please you.
[30721][30750]I should like to see you spar|with a proper partner, ser.
[30750][30774]( chuckles )
[30831][30846]How did you know?
[30846][30865]Know what?
[30879][30897]That I wanted to.
[30897][30916]My lord...
[30956][30973]I'll have you know|I'm to be married soon
[30973][31004]and even my intended|hasn't the slightest notion.
[31004][31035]They rarely do,|in my experience.
[31036][31059]You have a good deal|of experience, do you?
[31069][31090]With the husbands.
[31179][31202]That didn't take long.
[31203][31225]Well, it took long enough.
[31240][31270]It seems our Knight of Flowers|is engaged to be wed.
[31270][31288]Is he?
[31289][31312]And...
[31312][31330]who's the lucky girl?
[31330][31365]Littlefinger: <i>She may not be|the grandest ship in the world</i>
[31366][31390]or the fastest,
[31391][31412]but she's mine.
[31448][31467]I've always wanted a ship.
[31468][31489]Now I want a dozen.
[31489][31516]- Strange, isn't it?|- What is?
[31516][31538]It doesn't matter what we want,
[31538][31556]once we get it,
[31556][31574]then we want something else.
[31601][31628]Your hair is different.
[31629][31645]Is it?
[31645][31661]Lady Margaery|wears it that way.
[31662][31686]Many ladies wear it this way.
[31686][31703]I have good news.
[31704][31725]I'll be leaving the city soon.
[31725][31740]You still want me|to come with you?
[31740][31762]It's not a question|of what I want.
[31763][31785]It's what you want.
[31785][31797]You want to go home, don't you?
[31797][31822]Of course.|More than anything.
[31843][31877]But maybe it would|be better to wait.
[31878][31906]I've been thinking|how dangerous it would be.
[31906][31935]Not just for me, but for you.
[31935][31948]You've been so kind.
[31948][31980]I'd feel terrible if|anything happened to you.
[31991][32013]I can't tell you|how touched I am
[32014][32046]by your concern for my welfare.
[32046][32074]I hope you know that|I'm your friend, Sansa.
[32075][32095]Your true friend.
[32096][32113]I do, Lord Baelish.
[32113][32140]- Petyr.|- Petyr.
[32140][32161]If you wish to stay,
[32161][32191]then of course you will stay.
[32240][32264]We'll speak again|when I return.
[32394][32415]Tywin:|<i>You're late.</i>
[32416][32444]What's she doing here?
[32444][32465]Our business concerns her, too.
[32465][32483]<i>Sit.</i>
[32503][32519]You'll be pleased to learn
[32520][32550]that after one conversation|with Olenna Tyrell,
[32551][32571]I've saved the crown
[32571][32599]hundreds of thousands|on this wedding.
[32600][32610]Never mind that now.
[32610][32626]We have something|important to discuss.
[32626][32650]I'm Master of Coin.|Saving money is important.
[32659][32673]Stop that.
[32674][32693]You're making me uncomfortable.
[32693][32723]Your sister has learned that|your new friends the Tyrells
[32723][32753]are plotting to marry|Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.
[32754][32772]Very well.
[32772][32792]She's a lovely girl.
[32793][32813]Missing some of Loras'|favorite bits,
[32813][32831]but I'm sure they'll make do.
[32831][32857]- Your jokes are not appreciated.|- It wasn't my best, but--
[32857][32888]I bring them into the royal fold|and this is how they repay me,
[32888][32923]by trying to steal the key to|the North out from under me.
[32923][32940]Sansa is the key to the North?
[32940][32964]I seem to remember|she has an older brother.
[32964][32984]The Karstarks|have marched home.
[32985][33014]The young wolf has lost half his army.|His days are numbered.
[33014][33045]<i>Theon Greyjoy murdered</i>|<i>both his brothers.</i>
[33046][33079]That makes Sansa Stark|the heir to Winterfell.
[33080][33118]And I am not about to hand|her over to the Tyrells.
[33118][33141]Tyrion: <i>The Tyrell army is|helping us to win this war.</i>
[33142][33169]Do you really think|it's wise to refuse them?
[33170][33188]There's nothing to refuse.|This is a plot.
[33188][33216]<i>Plots are not public knowledge.</i>
[33216][33234]And the Tyrells|won't carry this one out
[33234][33256]until after Joffrey's wedding.
[33256][33294]We need to act first and|kill this union in its crib.
[33294][33308]And how do we do that?
[33308][33331]We find Sansa Stark|a different husband.
[33331][33357]- Wonderful.|- Yes, it is.
[33433][33449]You can't mean it.
[33449][33464]I can and I do.
[33464][33495]Joffrey has made this|poor girl's life miserable
[33496][33516]since the day he took|her father's head.
[33516][33547]Now she's finally free of|him and you give her to me?
[33547][33564]That's cruel even for you.
[33564][33583]Do you intend|on mistreating her?
[33583][33603]The girl's happiness|is not my concern,
[33603][33625]- nor should it be yours.|- She's a child!
[33626][33654]She's flowered, I assure you. She|and I have discussed it at length.
[33655][33690]There, you see? You will wed her,|bed her, and put a child in her.
[33690][33720]- <i>Surely you're capable of that.</i>|- And if I refuse?
[33721][33748]You wanted to be rewarded|for your valor in battle.
[33748][33788]Sansa Stark is a finer reward than|you could ever dare hope for.
[33788][33813]And it is past time|you were wed.
[33814][33842]I was wed.
[33842][33868]Or don't you remember?
[33882][33904]Only too well.
[33904][33938]Cersei: <i>You should be|thanking the gods for this.</i>
[33938][33954]This is more than you deserve.
[33955][33979]Tywin:|<i>Tyrion will do as he's bid.</i>
[33980][34000]As will you.
[34014][34035]What do you mean?
[34036][34054]You'll marry Ser Loras.
[34076][34101]- I will not.|- The boy is heir to Highgarden.
[34101][34126]Tyrion will secure the North,|you will secure the Reach.
[34126][34153]- No, I won't do it.|- Yes, you will.
[34154][34181]You're still fertile. You need|to marry again and breed.
[34181][34203]I am Queen Regent,|not some broodmare.
[34203][34230]You're my daughter!
[34230][34246]You will do as I command
[34247][34269]and you will marry Loras Tyrell
[34269][34293]and put an end|to the disgusting rumors
[34293][34321]about you once and for all.
[34321][34342]Father, don't make me|do it again, please.
[34343][34368]Not another word.
[34369][34399]My children.
[34400][34439]You've disgraced the Lannister|name for far too long.
