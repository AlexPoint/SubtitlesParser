1
00:00:00,061 --> 00:00:01,073
Kids, there's more than one
story of I met your mother.

2
00:00:01,107 --> 00:00:02,536
And that story begins here.
Host: www. CsSubs. org - Thanks Guys

3
00:00:03,111 --> 00:00:04,884
You know the short version,

4
00:00:04,885 --> 00:00:06,716
the thing with your mom's
yellow umbrella.

5
00:00:06,717 --> 00:00:08,238
But there's a bigger story.

6
00:00:08,239 --> 00:00:10,316
The story of how I became
who I had to become

7
00:00:10,317 --> 00:00:12,093
before I could meet her.

8
00:00:12,094 --> 00:00:14,637
And that story begins here.

9
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:15,915
...dary!

10
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,437
Legendary!

11
00:00:17,438 --> 00:00:19,754
Dude, I am so excited
that you're single again.

12
00:00:19,755 --> 00:00:22,164
We are going to conquer
New York City.

13
00:00:22,165 --> 00:00:24,277
I already have a girl
from work lined up for you.

14
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:25,993
Right boob bigger
than the left boob,

15
00:00:25,994 --> 00:00:27,834
which some choose to look
at as bra half empty,

16
00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:30,603
I choose to look
at as bra half full.

17
00:00:30,604 --> 00:00:31,757
I don't know.

18
00:00:31,758 --> 00:00:33,508
Robin and I broke up
two weeks ago.

19
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:36,143
I'm... I'm not ready.

20
00:00:36,144 --> 00:00:37,963
When will you be ready?

21
00:00:37,964 --> 00:00:39,275
It was a good question.

22
00:00:39,276 --> 00:00:40,775
After a big relationship ends,

23
00:00:40,776 --> 00:00:42,190
you need some time
to recuperate.

24
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:43,805
Robin took a trip to Argentina,

25
00:00:43,806 --> 00:00:45,945
and I went through
my usual routine.

26
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:47,478
I grew my breakup beard.

27
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:49,421
Ted Mosby, suit up,
'cause here's the plan.

28
00:00:49,422 --> 00:00:50,875
There's a Miss Nassau
County pageant.

29
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:51,858
We'll pretend to be judges

30
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:54,712
and, yes, our votes
are for sale.

31
00:00:54,713 --> 00:00:56,666
I'm not ready.

32
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:57,851
I repainted the apartment.

33
00:00:57,852 --> 00:01:00,090
Finish Line of a women's 10K.

34
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:01,903
Salty girls on
an endorphin high

35
00:01:01,904 --> 00:01:04,357
who just want to lie down.

36
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:06,948
Yeah.
I'm not ready.

37
00:01:06,949 --> 00:01:09,199
And the truth is,
I was doing really good.

38
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,287
Female acrobats
from Montreal.

39
00:01:10,776 --> 00:01:12,118
Hmm.

40
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,377
Super flexible.
We are going to get

41
00:01:13,378 --> 00:01:15,082
Cirque de So-Laid.

42
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,729
What up?

43
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:17,752
Barney, come on,
we've covered this.

44
00:01:17,753 --> 00:01:18,525
Robin!

45
00:01:18,526 --> 00:01:19,629
Hey, guys.

46
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,285
I just got in last night.

47
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:25,842
Um, uh, this is Gael.

48
00:01:25,843 --> 00:01:27,655
Hola.

49
00:01:27,656 --> 00:01:29,294
Okay, I'm ready.

50
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,033
Subsfactory presents:
How I Met Your Mother

51
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:37,197
Season 3 Episode 1
"Wait For It"

52
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:41,210
Synch by: redman

53
00:01:43,817 --> 00:01:45,410
I just can't believe her.

54
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:47,195
We have this totally
amicable split,

55
00:01:47,196 --> 00:01:48,291
everything's cool.

56
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:50,676
And she comes back
from vacation withthatguy?

57
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,032
You know what she's doing?

58
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:53,315
She's trying to win the breakup.

59
00:01:53,316 --> 00:01:56,954
What do you mean "win the
breakup," old-timey inventor?

60
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:59,111
What our 21st president,
Chester A. Arthur,

61
00:01:59,112 --> 00:02:00,724
is trying to say is that

62
00:02:00,725 --> 00:02:03,090
in every breakup there are
winners and a losers.

63
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:04,978
It's not a
competition.

64
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,866
Now, your 80-day
balloon race around the world,

65
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:09,458
that was a competion.

66
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:11,007
That's my wife.

67
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:12,761
Of course it's
a competition, Lil.

68
00:02:12,762 --> 00:02:15,562
How else do you explain...
what's his name?

69
00:02:15,563 --> 00:02:18,443
Gael.

70
00:02:18,444 --> 00:02:21,113
I'm sorry, Gayle?

71
00:02:21,114 --> 00:02:23,178
Gael.

72
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:25,472
Kyle?

73
00:02:25,473 --> 00:02:27,891
Gael.

74
00:02:27,892 --> 00:02:31,255
Girl?

75
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:33,737
It's pronounced "guy-el. "

76
00:02:33,738 --> 00:02:35,314
It means "joyful. "

77
00:02:35,315 --> 00:02:37,805
That is why I live
my life by bringing joy,

78
00:02:37,806 --> 00:02:41,619
good energy
and happiness to others.

79
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,402
Especially those
less fortunate that I.

80
00:02:44,402 --> 00:02:46,794
I'm sorry, so it's Gayle?

81
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:48,606
What a jerk.

82
00:02:48,607 --> 00:02:49,815
I don't go
to your stupid country

83
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:52,689
and try to seduce women
with my sexy accent.

84
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,068
That's a great point,
Persian nightclub owner.

85
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:58,917
Oh, and he's a masseuse.

86
00:02:58,918 --> 00:03:02,302
With a massage,
everything is connected.

87
00:03:02,303 --> 00:03:05,807
I can touch your foot,
cleanse your kidney.

88
00:03:05,808 --> 00:03:07,555
I can touch
your earlobe,

89
00:03:07,556 --> 00:03:10,177
and slow your heartbeat.

90
00:03:10,178 --> 00:03:12,613
One time, I used warm water
to make a guy pee.

91
00:03:12,614 --> 00:03:14,976
Of course, I didn't
make a career out of it.

92
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:16,503
Career?

93
00:03:16,504 --> 00:03:18,114
Such an American idea.

94
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:21,371
My career is living.
Windsurfing.

95
00:03:21,372 --> 00:03:23,660
Making love.

96
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,505
Sometimes at the same time.

97
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,252
How?

98
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:30,617
How would one do that exactly?

99
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:32,841
Seriously, don't giggle.
Tell me.

100
00:03:32,842 --> 00:03:33,858
Not possible.

101
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:36,269
You cannot have sex
on a windsurfing board.

102
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,353
How do you know?
Glad you asked, Lily.

103
00:03:38,354 --> 00:03:41,079
I have crafted a list
of every vehicle...

104
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,787
land-based, aquatic
and airborne...

105
00:03:42,788 --> 00:03:45,146
in which/on which it's
possible to have sex.

106
00:03:45,147 --> 00:03:47,021
And of those 33 vehicles,

107
00:03:47,022 --> 00:03:50,126
I have had sex in/on 31.

108
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:52,966
Windsurfing board,
not on the list, not possible.

109
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:55,139
Oh, P.S., in order
to hit 33, all I need is

110
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,460
bobsled and the Apollo 11
space capsule.

111
00:03:58,461 --> 00:04:01,597
To get that last one, you'd have
to break into the Smithsonian.

112
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:03,609
This conversation
never happened.

113
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,234
All right, you're suited up,
I'm bearded down.

114
00:04:07,235 --> 00:04:08,345
Let's get out there
and win this thing.

115
00:04:08,346 --> 00:04:09,526
Yes!

116
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:11,804
You guys, have fun
on your double date.

117
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:14,442
Oh, for the hundredth time,
I'm sorry, there was a lull.

118
00:04:14,443 --> 00:04:16,527
And then we fell asleep
on the beach

119
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:17,805
while counting the stars.

120
00:04:17,806 --> 00:04:21,959
Do you want to have
dinner with me? Uh, us?

121
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:23,338
There was no lull.

122
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:24,953
You just think
he's incredibly hot.

123
00:04:24,954 --> 00:04:26,481
No, I don't!

124
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:29,368
Not incredibly.

125
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,442
It's a little hard to believe
how hot he is.

126
00:04:31,443 --> 00:04:32,232
But, I mean,

127
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:33,374
she's serious
about him.

128
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,818
The girl never marries
the hot guy.

129
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:37,158
Well, you did.

130
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,711
I'm one of the lucky few.

131
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,682
Lily, Ted is our best friend,

132
00:04:41,683 --> 00:04:42,856
so let's get something straight:

133
00:04:42,857 --> 00:04:45,393
Male Gayle is not hot.

134
00:04:45,394 --> 00:04:47,245
He's not our friend.
Don't even look at him.

135
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:49,568
Just... no eye contact.

136
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:51,033
So that night,
as Lily and Marshall

137
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:52,524
did their best to hate Gael...

138
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:55,356
Hey, Robin. Gael.

139
00:04:55,357 --> 00:04:57,521
...Robin pulled me aside
to check in.

140
00:04:57,522 --> 00:04:59,384
Now, I'm sure
she meant the best,

141
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:01,410
but she said the worst.

142
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:03,064
I just want to make sure
you're okay with this.

143
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:05,767
"I just want to make sure
you're okay with this"?

144
00:05:05,768 --> 00:05:07,271
Damn it! I can't
believe she's the one

145
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:08,403
that gets to say that.

146
00:05:08,404 --> 00:05:09,982
She's winning, isn't she?

147
00:05:09,983 --> 00:05:11,049
Not for long.

148
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,106
Okay, pep talk.
Take a knee.

149
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:15,402
Ted, tonight we're going to get

150
00:05:15,403 --> 00:05:18,179
you someone way hotter
than Robin.

151
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,033
Okay, Robin's a ten.

152
00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:21,669
Fine, we'll get you a 12.

153
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,846
Or, you know...

154
00:05:23,847 --> 00:05:25,654
two sixes.

155
00:05:25,655 --> 00:05:27,420
Failing that, four threes.

156
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:29,250
And break glass
in case of emergency,

157
00:05:29,251 --> 00:05:31,046
we'll go to Staten Island,
I'll get you 12 ones.

158
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:35,171
Ted, my boy,
I am going to re-teach you...

159
00:05:35,953 --> 00:05:39,268
Amy.
Ted.

160
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,605
Barney.

161
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:46,762
Ted, we are back!

162
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,821
Up here.

163
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:51,665
Up high.

164
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:55,263
Fivin' it up
five-style!

165
00:05:56,092 --> 00:05:57,617
I'm sorry this is
all so weird.

166
00:05:57,618 --> 00:05:59,215
Weird, why would it be weird?

167
00:05:59,216 --> 00:06:00,707
Because you used
to date our best friend

168
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,816
or because my wife thinks

169
00:06:02,816 --> 00:06:04,717
your new boyfriend
is incredibly hot?

170
00:06:04,718 --> 00:06:06,666
I do not! Shut up!

171
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:10,016
Oh, my God!

172
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:11,462
I just hope Ted's okay.

173
00:06:11,463 --> 00:06:12,621
Hmm.

174
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,529
I hate to see you so tense.

175
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,272
I mean, we had a really
clean break up, you know?

176
00:06:18,273 --> 00:06:19,739
We really acted like adults,

177
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,366
so the last thing... oh!

178
00:06:26,362 --> 00:06:29,092
Gael, are you a properly
licensed massage therapist?

179
00:06:29,093 --> 00:06:30,473
What?
Are you legally

180
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:33,188
certified by some type
of governing entity?

181
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:35,610
I train for three years at
an institute in Buenos Aires.

182
00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:37,748
I have a card.
I can show you.

183
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:39,233
Is the card laminated?

184
00:06:39,234 --> 00:06:40,613
What do you mean "laminated"?

185
00:06:40,614 --> 00:06:42,806
Covered in protective plastic.

186
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:45,235
Oh, yes.
Damn it.

187
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:47,674
He checks out.

188
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:52,556
Ted. Ted.

189
00:06:52,557 --> 00:06:55,704
What?!

190
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:57,164
Let's bail, this
place is dead.

191
00:06:57,165 --> 00:06:58,007
Yeah, you're right.

192
00:06:58,008 --> 00:06:59,403
We're both totally striking out.

193
00:06:59,404 --> 00:07:00,743
Exactly, plus,

194
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:03,002
we're on a tight schedule.
I've got this entire evening

195
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:05,238
perfectly planned
out... spoiler alert:

196
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,728
our last stop is
an after hours club

197
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:09,267
so after hours, it's
three days from now.

198
00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:11,314
What up.

199
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:12,278
Are you blind?

200
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:14,274
I'm making out with a 12.
I am winning.

201
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:15,992
Yeah, but I didn't get to help.

202
00:07:15,993 --> 00:07:17,191
So you're saying
you want me to throw away

203
00:07:17,192 --> 00:07:20,380
a super hot girl just because
you didn't help me get her?

204
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:22,165
Apology accepted.
Let's go.

205
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,642
Who's the suit?

206
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,713
This is Barney.
Barney, Amy.

207
00:07:25,714 --> 00:07:27,052
I'm not gonna remember that.

208
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:28,153
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

209
00:07:28,154 --> 00:07:29,915
random chick from
earlier tonight,

210
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,805
as you shall
henceforth be known,

211
00:07:31,806 --> 00:07:33,500
Ted and I have a
schedule to keep.

212
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,328
Oh, well, you can check off
8:54, dress up like a dork

213
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:38,028
and bother the cool kids.

214
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:39,770
Beat it, nerd.

215
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:41,314
Wow. Wow.

216
00:07:41,315 --> 00:07:43,031
Great stuff, Tommy Lee.

217
00:07:43,032 --> 00:07:43,967
See, what you don't
understand is

218
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:45,812
I'm Ted's wingman.

219
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:47,677
It's a sacred bond,
much stronger than any...

220
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:50,496
They're making out again.

221
00:07:50,497 --> 00:07:53,072
Massage therapist.

222
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,904
And you know what, "Gayle"?

223
00:07:54,905 --> 00:07:59,127
Your piece of chicken
looks a little tense to me.

224
00:07:59,128 --> 00:08:01,950
Oh, oh, does that
feel good, Mr. Chicken?

225
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,144
Well, guess what?

226
00:08:03,145 --> 00:08:05,578
I didn't wash my hands.

227
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:08,766
Got him.

228
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:10,177
Lily!

229
00:08:10,178 --> 00:08:12,209
We carry so much
ancient emotion

230
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,972
in our neck
and shoulders.

231
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:16,530
Things we should have
let go of years ago.

232
00:08:16,531 --> 00:08:20,011
I forgive you, Mom.

233
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:22,855
Lily, we are Ted's
best friends.

234
00:08:22,856 --> 00:08:24,786
Our job is to hate that guy.

235
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:26,920
Oh, yeah,
that's what I was doing.

236
00:08:26,921 --> 00:08:30,153
I was just building him up
so a few minutes later,

237
00:08:30,154 --> 00:08:33,926
I could totally cut him down.

238
00:08:35,543 --> 00:08:38,863
Weren't you wearing a bra?

239
00:08:38,864 --> 00:08:39,623
The night was going great.

240
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:41,545
Amy was cool and dangerous.

241
00:08:41,546 --> 00:08:43,156
She found a friend for Barney.

242
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:44,697
She even paid for drinks...

243
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:47,034
sort of.

244
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:48,230
They know us here.

245
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:49,404
You're gonna get
us in trouble.

246
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:50,365
Tell me something.

247
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:51,815
Do you ask your tailor
to leave extra room

248
00:08:51,816 --> 00:08:55,735
in the crotch
for your huge vagina?

249
00:08:56,579 --> 00:09:00,118
You... your vagina...

250
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:02,826
Ted, this chick is crazy.

251
00:09:02,827 --> 00:09:04,242
We're leaving.
Good idea.

252
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,483
Let's all go back
to my place.

253
00:09:05,484 --> 00:09:07,837
Your place?
Thanks but no thanks,

254
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,400
1994 Courtney Love.

255
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:13,564
I have a hot tub.

256
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:17,483
Okay, this is
actually pretty nice.

257
00:09:18,656 --> 00:09:20,685
I like your tatts.

258
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,628
Thanks, you can play
with them if you want.

259
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:25,086
They're a hundred
percent real.

260
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:29,064
No, your tatts... toos,
your tattoos.

261
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:31,550
Thanks.

262
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:32,559
You should get one.

263
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,621
Wrong. Ted has a classic,
clean-cut look

264
00:09:35,622 --> 00:09:39,582
that never goes out of style
season after season, burn.

265
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,337
Yeah? Well, I think he
would look hot with some ink.

266
00:09:42,337 --> 00:09:44,124
No, he wouldn't.
Yes, he would.

267
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,338
No, he wouldn't.

268
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:46,428
Yuh-huh.
Nuh-uh.

269
00:09:46,492 --> 00:09:47,564
Ma...

270
00:09:47,598 --> 00:09:49,425
I'm ready to do anything
you want by the way.

271
00:09:49,426 --> 00:09:52,935
Anything. Right now.

272
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,729
Ted, who are you gonna side
with on this tattoo thing?

273
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,321
I think I'd look
way hot with some ink.

274
00:09:58,322 --> 00:10:01,860
Yeah, you would.
Yeah.

275
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:03,635
Oh, my God!
Tyler?

276
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:04,872
Mommy! Daddy!

277
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:06,605
She's back!

278
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:11,051
Damn it, they're supposed
to be in the Hamptons. Run!

279
00:10:12,384 --> 00:10:14,845
Sorry. I used to nanny

280
00:10:14,845 --> 00:10:16,476
for those jerks
before they fired me.

281
00:10:16,477 --> 00:10:18,139
So unfair.
Unfair?

282
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,906
I wouldn't let you take care
of the imaginary kids

283
00:10:19,907 --> 00:10:21,350
I make up to score
with single moms.

284
00:10:21,546 --> 00:10:23,082
That's it, Ted.

285
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:26,505
We're going home.

286
00:10:26,648 --> 00:10:28,642
Ted?

287
00:10:28,643 --> 00:10:30,516
Ted, you okay?

288
00:10:30,517 --> 00:10:32,638
Hello, Ted.
Robin and I are about to make

289
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,363
fantastic aquatic sex
on this windsurfing board.

290
00:10:35,364 --> 00:10:39,750
And I just want to make sure
you're okay with this.

291
00:10:41,668 --> 00:10:43,279
Okay, how do we do this?

292
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,269
I think your leg
goes up, up...

293
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,558
Okay, how about if I, um...

294
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,305
No, mine...

295
00:10:49,306 --> 00:10:50,812
I'm okay.

296
00:10:50,813 --> 00:10:53,505
In fact, here's
how okay I am.

297
00:10:53,506 --> 00:10:54,499
I'm getting a tattoo.

298
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,219
You're not getting
a tattoo, it's not you.

299
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,227
Ted, you are heading
down a dark path.

300
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,349
That dark path
is my driveway.

301
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,552
But you need a plan

302
00:11:05,553 --> 00:11:07,412
and you need a wingman!

303
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:11,127
This is so going
in my blog!

304
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,011
Want to have sex?

305
00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:19,119
Okay.

306
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,090
And underneath,

307
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:22,270
it should
say, "I win. "

308
00:11:22,271 --> 00:11:24,433
And then it should have
flames coming out the bottom.

309
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,899
Fire!

310
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,014
We should start a fire.

311
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:30,296
After this maybe.

312
00:11:30,297 --> 00:11:32,169
Oh, man, this is
going to be legend.

313
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,359
Wait for it.

314
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,822
And that's all I rember.

315
00:11:34,823 --> 00:11:39,005
The next morning,
I woke up alone back home.

316
00:11:57,428 --> 00:11:58,848
Hey, buddy, how
was your night?

317
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:01,235
You know,
it was great.

318
00:12:01,236 --> 00:12:03,798
I met this crazy girl,
I almost got a tattoo.

319
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,136
Don't worry.

320
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:06,924
I didn't, but it was...

321
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:08,457
It was amazing.

322
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:12,874
I think it's safe to say,
I am winning this breakup.

323
00:12:13,351 --> 00:12:15,390
Look.

324
00:12:15,391 --> 00:12:16,700
Oh, my God.

325
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:17,658
What?

326
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:18,494
Nothing.

327
00:12:18,495 --> 00:12:19,975
This J. Crew catalog.

328
00:12:19,976 --> 00:12:24,158
Who brings two Golden
Retrievers in a canoe?

329
00:12:25,137 --> 00:12:26,066
We got to
call Barney.

330
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:28,930
Way ahead of you.

331
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:30,455
Hey, guys, what's
the big emergency?

332
00:12:30,456 --> 00:12:31,922
Oh, and B the W:

333
00:12:31,923 --> 00:12:33,546
I am never speaking
to Ted again.

334
00:12:33,547 --> 00:12:34,877
Mm.
Really? Never?

335
00:12:34,878 --> 00:12:38,731
Not even if, say,
butterflies flew out of his ass?

336
00:12:38,732 --> 00:12:41,486
What?

337
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:42,610
Ted?
Could you grab me

338
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:46,266
the fondue pot?

339
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:50,210
He has no idea.

340
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:53,769
And up we go.

341
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:56,996
Thank you.

342
00:12:56,997 --> 00:12:58,987
What?

343
00:12:58,988 --> 00:12:59,880
Ted?
Mm?

344
00:12:59,881 --> 00:13:03,111
I came here
this morning because...

345
00:13:03,112 --> 00:13:05,183
I want to apologize.

346
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,463
Apology accepted, Barney.

347
00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:09,469
As you can see, I do
just fine on my own.

348
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,761
I don't need a baby-sitter.

349
00:13:10,762 --> 00:13:12,115
See, all this time,

350
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:13,791
I thought you need
a wingman to fly,

351
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,928
but the truth is, you...

352
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,311
you've got your
own wings now.

353
00:13:17,312 --> 00:13:18,610
Mm.

354
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,926
Since you and Robin split,
you've been gestating.

355
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:25,465
Growing in your coon.

356
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:26,988
And last night...

357
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:30,258
...you burst out of
that cocoon like a...

358
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:33,176
like a majestic, uh...

359
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:35,895
Gosh, what is it that
comes out of a cocoon?

360
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:38,121
I was always
bad at science.

361
00:13:38,122 --> 00:13:40,390
He's going to say it!

362
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:43,846
A butterfly?

363
00:13:43,847 --> 00:13:44,683
What?

364
00:13:44,684 --> 00:13:46,865
Nothing, buddy.

365
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:50,609
Ow! Why did that hurt so...?

366
00:13:53,304 --> 00:13:56,395
Oh, my God!

367
00:13:56,396 --> 00:13:58,650
I have a tattoo!

368
00:13:58,651 --> 00:13:59,822
Oh, that's not a tattoo.

369
00:13:59,823 --> 00:14:03,042
That, dear boy,
is a tramp stamp.

370
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,271
A tramp stamp.

371
00:14:04,272 --> 00:14:06,060
You know, a ho tag.

372
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:07,635
Ass antlers.

373
00:14:07,636 --> 00:14:10,119
A Panama City license plate.

374
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,009
And suddenly,
it all came back to me.

375
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,457
...dary!

376
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,855
Legendary!

377
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,181
Man, I am so winning
this breakup.

378
00:14:20,182 --> 00:14:21,856
Mm. I just broke up

379
00:14:21,857 --> 00:14:23,296
with my boyfriend Steve.

380
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:24,836
He was totally annoying.
He was, like,

381
00:14:24,837 --> 00:14:26,694
"I think you're the one,
I want to marry you. "

382
00:14:26,695 --> 00:14:28,050
What a wuss.

383
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:29,707
Do you think

384
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,038
exes can be friends?

385
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,361
Yeah, sure.

386
00:14:32,362 --> 00:14:35,971
I mean, we're still friends,
right, Steve?

387
00:14:35,972 --> 00:14:37,806
Hey, your
name is Steve.

388
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:38,871
And her

389
00:14:38,872 --> 00:14:41,138
ex-boyfriend's name is Steve.

390
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:43,283
What are the odds of that...?

391
00:14:43,284 --> 00:14:46,647
Wait.

392
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:48,766
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

393
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:50,890
Give me this.

394
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,813
Oh, yeah, that'll
get it out.

395
00:14:52,814 --> 00:14:55,123
Maybe you should
try club soda.

396
00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:56,251
Ow. Damn it, it really hurts.

397
00:14:56,252 --> 00:14:57,139
I need, like,

398
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,460
some ointment
or something.

399
00:14:58,461 --> 00:14:59,715
What's this?

400
00:14:59,716 --> 00:15:03,225
Spanish massage oil.

401
00:15:03,506 --> 00:15:07,015
Spanish massage oil?

402
00:15:08,277 --> 00:15:12,079
What happened here last night?

403
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:15,787
Last night got weird.

404
00:15:41,314 --> 00:15:43,840
Feel the emotions release.

405
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:48,316
Think I just got over
being chunky in the ninth grade.

406
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,411
You're beautiful.

407
00:15:51,412 --> 00:15:55,067
I am beautiful.

408
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,789
Experience your food.

409
00:16:02,474 --> 00:16:06,081
Try the mango.

410
00:16:07,686 --> 00:16:10,486
Okay, that's enough
of the fruit.

411
00:16:10,487 --> 00:16:11,801
We're sorry, Ted.

412
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:13,109
It'll never happen again.

413
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,161
It meant
nothing to us.

414
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:16,512
It just felt really,
really, really good.

415
00:16:16,513 --> 00:16:18,942
Oh! I can't even look
at you two right now.

416
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,160
Ted...

417
00:16:23,654 --> 00:16:27,193
He got a tramp stamp.

418
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,648
All right, first of all,
this isn't one of those,

419
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:40,225
"I came all the way over here
because I want you back" things.

420
00:16:40,226 --> 00:16:42,384
There'll be no startling
confession of love,

421
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:44,153
no sweet indie rock
song that swells up

422
00:16:44,154 --> 00:16:46,259
just as we're about to kiss,
none of that crap. Got it?

423
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,414
Okay.
Good.

424
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:49,165
Now, here's the thing.

425
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,588
It sucks that you came
back from Argentina

426
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:52,304
with someone as
awesome as Gael.

427
00:16:52,305 --> 00:16:54,282
And I know I have no
right to be upset at you.

428
00:16:54,283 --> 00:16:56,239
We're broken up, life
goes on, whatever.

429
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,984
But you know what?
We-We never did this.

430
00:16:57,985 --> 00:16:59,523
We-We had this
polite breakup

431
00:16:59,524 --> 00:17:01,144
with no irrational
yelling, and...

432
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,266
and that's just wrong!

433
00:17:02,266 --> 00:17:04,886
So, I'm going to yell
irrationally for a little while,

434
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:06,179
and you're just going
to have to stand there

435
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,552
and deal with it, okay?

436
00:17:07,553 --> 00:17:08,838
If you feel like
you need to do that, then...

437
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,201
I think I do!

438
00:17:10,202 --> 00:17:11,556
I really think I do!

439
00:17:11,557 --> 00:17:15,037
So now I'm yelling!

440
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:16,818
You shaved.
I did!

441
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,384
I liked the beard.
I liked it, too, but it

442
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:19,724
was getting kind of hot!

443
00:17:19,725 --> 00:17:20,668
Maybe in the winter,

444
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:24,237
I'll grow it back out!

445
00:17:24,597 --> 00:17:26,659
Okay, I'm done.

446
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,583
I know it was weird
showing up with Gael.

447
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:32,598
I'm sorry.

448
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:35,645
Look, us breaking up...
it was the right thing.

449
00:17:35,646 --> 00:17:37,756
But it took some time to
get over you, you know?

450
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,713
I- I'm still
getting over you.

451
00:17:39,714 --> 00:17:40,698
But you? You were over it

452
00:17:40,699 --> 00:17:41,956
the minute they started
the in-flight movie.

453
00:17:41,957 --> 00:17:43,247
Over it?!

454
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:44,596
My first three days
in Argentina,

455
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,853
I cried my eyes out.

456
00:17:46,854 --> 00:17:47,705
I missed you

457
00:17:47,706 --> 00:17:49,144
so much.

458
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:51,667
I wanted to go
and prove how adventurous I am,

459
00:17:51,668 --> 00:17:54,956
but the truth is...
it was really lonely.

460
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:58,339
And that's why Gael happened.

461
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,517
You weren't trying
to win the breakup?

462
00:18:00,518 --> 00:18:04,231
I was trying to survive it.

463
00:18:04,697 --> 00:18:05,883
Okay.

464
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:06,616
No.

465
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:08,807
See, look, that
all sounds good, and

466
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:11,262
we'll still be friends
and move on, but...

467
00:18:11,263 --> 00:18:13,160
did he have to be so hot?

468
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:14,335
The guy's
an Adonis.

469
00:18:14,336 --> 00:18:15,447
He's not an Adonis.

470
00:18:15,448 --> 00:18:17,795
He's the Cadillac
of rebound guys.

471
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,771
Marshall has a
crush on him!

472
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:20,548
The guy's perfect.

473
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:21,346
He's not perfect.

474
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:22,515
Oh, come on.

475
00:18:22,516 --> 00:18:26,398
He's hot, he wind surfs,
he massages things.

476
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:29,205
Name one way I'm
better than that guy.

477
00:18:29,206 --> 00:18:30,484
You're bigger.

478
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:31,595
Don't patronize
me. If anything,

479
00:18:31,596 --> 00:18:32,955
he may even be a
little bit taller.

480
00:18:32,956 --> 00:18:36,612
No. Ted... you're bigger.

481
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:39,519
I win!

482
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,669
Kids, I can't remember exactly

483
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,661
what helped me get through
the whole Robin-Gael incident.

484
00:18:43,662 --> 00:18:46,754
I'm sure that it was something
profound and meaningful,

485
00:18:46,755 --> 00:18:49,577
and not at all macho and petty,

486
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:52,376
but after that,
I was back on my feet.

487
00:18:52,377 --> 00:18:55,546
And what followed was a new era
in my life,a crazy time

488
00:18:55,547 --> 00:18:57,802
unlike anything
that came before.

489
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,678
It's funny looking back
at those days,

490
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,557
knowing now exactly
what I was heading towards.

491
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:07,389
And what was heading
towards me.

492
00:19:14,891 --> 00:19:16,081
Go for Barney.

493
00:19:16,082 --> 00:19:18,245
Hey, man, it's Marshall.

494
00:19:18,246 --> 00:19:19,567
Check your e-mail.

495
00:19:19,568 --> 00:19:21,256
Sent you something.

496
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:22,163
What is it?

497
00:19:22,164 --> 00:19:23,868
Just a new Web site.

498
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:27,349
Slapcountdown. com.

499
00:19:29,324 --> 00:19:31,507
What does this mean?

500
00:19:31,508 --> 00:19:33,883
M- Marshall?

501
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:35,945
No.
