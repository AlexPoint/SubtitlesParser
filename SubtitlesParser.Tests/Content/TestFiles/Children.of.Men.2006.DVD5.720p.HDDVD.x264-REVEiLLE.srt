 Subtites By Rajanee

2
00:00:41.628 --> 00:00:43.922
 The Homeland Security bill is ratified.

3
00:00:43.922 --> 00:00:47.050
 After eight years,
 British borders will remain closed.

4
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.055
 The deportation of illegal immigrants
 will continue.
 Good morning. Our lead story.

5
00:00:52.055 --> 00:00:55.496
 The world was stunned today
 by the death of Diego Ricardo,

6
00:00:55.496 --> 00:00:58.207
 the youngest person on the planet.

7
00:00:58.207 --> 00:01:04.046
 Baby Diego was stabbed outside a bar
 in Buenos Aires
 after refusing
to sign an autograph.

8
00:01:04.046 --> 00:01:06.653
 Witnesses at the scene say...
 Excuse me.

9
00:01:06.653 --> 00:01:10.303
 ...that Diego spat in the face of a fan
 who asked for an autograph.

10
00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:13.952
 He was killed in the ensuing brawl.
 The fan was later beaten to death...

11
00:01:13.952 --> 00:01:16.663
 Coffee, please. Black.
 ...by the angry crowd.

12
00:01:16.663 --> 00:01:21.355
 Born in 2009,
 the son of Marcello and Sylvia Ricardo,

13
00:01:21.355 --> 00:01:24.066
 a working-class couple from Mendoza,

14
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:27.507
 he struggled all his life
 with the celebrity status

15
00:01:27.507 --> 00:01:30.739
 thrust upon him
 as the world's youngest person.

16
00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:39.186
 Diego Ricardo,
 the youngest person on the planet

17
00:01:39.186 --> 00:01:42.314
 was 18 years, 4 months,

18
00:01:42.314 --> 00:01:47.214
 20 days, 16 hours and 8 minutes old.

19
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:11.048
 Throughout his life,
 Diego Ricardo was a tragic reminder

20
00:03:11.048 --> 00:03:15.324
 of the 18 years of infertility
 that humanity has endured

21
00:03:15.324 --> 00:03:18.869
 and its effect upon the world we now live in.

22
00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:23.665
 It seems that the mantle of the world's
 youngest human has passed to
a woman.

23
00:03:23.665 --> 00:03:27.105
 She is 18 years, 5 months and 11 days old.

24
00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:32.632
 - Faron.
 - Mr. Griffiths.

25
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:38.784
 I seem to be more affected
 by Baby Diego's death than I realized, sir.

26
00:03:39.514 --> 00:03:43.268
 If you wouldn't mind, I'd appreciate it
 if I could finish my day's work at home.

27
00:03:43.268 --> 00:03:46.604
 ...generation needs
 to reject family and society.

28
00:04:10.274 --> 00:04:13.403
 - He's my dentist.
 - She's my house cleaner.

29
00:04:13.403 --> 00:04:17.886
 - He's the waiter.
 - She's my cousin.
 They are illegal immigrants.

30
00:04:17.886 --> 00:04:21.535
 To hire, feed or shelter
 illegal immigrants is a crime.

31
00:04:30.607 --> 00:04:32.170
 It's your life.

32
00:04:33.318 --> 00:04:34.986
 It's your choice.

33
00:05:00.429 --> 00:05:02.618
 Hey, amigo!

34
00:05:02.618 --> 00:05:03.869
 Jasper!

35
00:05:05.642 --> 00:05:07.727
 Good to see you. Come on.

36
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.861
 You know who did it?
 Islamic? Fishes? Fuck knows.

37
00:05:15.861 --> 00:05:17.738
 I'll bet it was the government.

38
00:05:17.738 --> 00:05:21.909
 Every time one of our politicians
 is in trouble, a bomb explodes.

39
00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:24.410
 It's the second time in a month.

40
00:05:25.245 --> 00:05:28.582
 - You okay?
 - It was horrible.

41
00:05:28.582 --> 00:05:31.813
 I'm glad you don't take
 cream or sugar, amigo.

42
00:05:32.336 --> 00:05:36.924
 Losing you and Baby Diego
 on the same day would be too hard to bear.

43
00:05:36.924 --> 00:05:39.009
 Well, that was even worse,
 everybody crying.

44
00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.554
 I mean, Baby Diego, come on.
 That guy was a wanker.

45
00:05:42.554 --> 00:05:46.412
 Yeah, but he was the youngest wanker
 on Earth.

46
00:05:46.412 --> 00:05:49.539
 Pull my finger. Quick, quick!
 Jasper...

47
00:05:50.062 --> 00:05:52.876
 Fucking hell! That's disgusting!

48
00:05:55.484 --> 00:05:58.507
 Illegal immigrants. Taking them to Bexhill.

49
00:05:59.133 --> 00:06:04.868
 Poor fugees.
 After escaping the worst atrocities
 and finally making
it to England,

50
00:06:04.868 --> 00:06:08.204
 our government hunts them down
 like cockroaches.

51
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.784
 - Any girls?
 - No.

52
00:06:24.784 --> 00:06:29.372
 What about the one we had lunch with?
 Lauren?
 Lorna. That was ages ago.

53
00:06:29.372 --> 00:06:33.647
 - I liked her. What happened?
 - She decided to renounce.

54
00:06:33.647 --> 00:06:37.401
 Renouncers? Are those the ones
 that kneel down for a month for salvation?

55
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:39.278
 No. They're the Repenters.

56
00:06:39.278 --> 00:06:44.283
 The Renouncers flagellate themselves
 for the forgiveness of humanity.
 Oh, right.

57
00:06:44.283 --> 00:06:47.514
 Dating ain't what it used to be, is it, amigo?

58
00:06:53.667 --> 00:06:55.857
 - What'd you do on your birthday?
 - Nothing.

59
00:06:55.857 --> 00:06:59.506
 Come on. You must've done something.
 No. Same as every other day.

60
00:06:59.506 --> 00:07:05.033
 Woke up, felt like shit,
 went to work, felt like shit.
 That's called a hangover, amigo.

61
00:07:05.033 --> 00:07:08.056
 At least with a hangover, I feel something.

62
00:07:08.056 --> 00:07:10.871
 Honestly, Jasper, sometimes...

63
00:07:11.497 --> 00:07:14.417
 You could always come and live with us.

64
00:07:14.417 --> 00:07:18.795
 Yeah, but if I did that,
 I wouldn't have anything to look forward to.

65
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.840
 Look who it is. It's Theo.
 - Hey, Janice, how you doing?
 - It's Theo.

66
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.133
 Your rebel with a lost cause.

67
00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:50.286
 She loves this color.

68
00:07:50.286 --> 00:07:52.788
 Don't you, darling? You love it.

69
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.803
 "Is there a chance it will not work for me?

70
00:08:08.638 --> 00:08:12.913
 "There have been no cases
 of anyone surviving
 "who has taken the preparation. "

71
00:08:12.913 --> 00:08:17.709
 Daddy government hands out suicide kits
 and anti-depressants in the rations,

72
00:08:17.709 --> 00:08:19.898
 but ganja is still illegal.

73
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:23.340
 Most of my weed goes to Bexhill now.

74
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:28.345
 This bloke buys it from me
 and smuggles it in.
 Guess what he does? His real job?

75
00:08:28.345 --> 00:08:30.431
 Immigration cop.

76
00:08:30.431 --> 00:08:31.576
 Bravo!

77
00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:37.520
 One of the many perks of having
 a refugee camp in the neighborhood.

78
00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:41.587
 Come on, taste that.

79
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.990
 Cough.

80
00:08:50.138 --> 00:08:51.805
 - Cough?
 - Cough.

81
00:08:57.437 --> 00:09:00.147
 You taste it? Strawberries.

82
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.275
 This is Strawberry Cough.

83
00:09:04.527 --> 00:09:07.342
 So, Human Project is having this dinner

84
00:09:07.342 --> 00:09:09.011
 and all the wisest men
 in the world are there...

85
00:09:09.011 --> 00:09:12.451
 "Human Project. "
 Why do people believe this crap?

86
00:09:13.286 --> 00:09:17.040
 You know, even if these people existed
 with these facilities in secret locations...

87
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.021
 Fuck me, that's strong.

88
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:22.983
 Even if they discovered
 the cure for infertility, it doesn't matter.

89
00:09:22.983 --> 00:09:25.485
 Too late. The world went to shit.

90
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.385
 You know what?
 It was too late before the infertility thing
 happened, for fuck's sake.

91
00:09:32.472 --> 00:09:35.286
 I was just trying to tell a joke, man.

92
00:09:36.643 --> 00:09:38.311
 I'm sorry. Go on.

93
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:40.188
 - No, I'm not telling it now.
 - No, come on, Jasper.

94
00:09:40.188 --> 00:09:42.690
 - No. Fuck it. I'm not fucking telling you.
 - It's all right. Go on.

95
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:46.444
 Okay. The Human Project
 gives this great big dinner

96
00:09:46.444 --> 00:09:49.051
 for all the scientists and sages in the world.

97
00:09:49.051 --> 00:09:52.492
 They're tossing around theories
 about the ultimate mystery,

98
00:09:52.492 --> 00:09:57.393
 why are women infertile?
 Why can't we make babies anymore?

99
00:09:57.393 --> 00:10:03.649
 Some of them say it's genetic experiments,
 gamma rays, pollution. Same old, same old.

100
00:10:03.649 --> 00:10:06.985
 Anyway, in the corner,
 this Englishman's sitting.

101
00:10:06.985 --> 00:10:11.782
 He hasn't said a word.
 He's just tucking into his dinner.
 So they decide to ask him.

102
00:10:11.782 --> 00:10:16.161
 They say, "Well, why do you think
 we can't make babies anymore?"

103
00:10:16.161 --> 00:10:20.019
 And he looks up at them,
 and he's chewing on this great big wing,

104
00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:23.356
 and he says, "I haven't the faintest idea,"
 he said.

105
00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:26.379
 "But this stork is quite tasty, isn't it?"

106
00:10:27.944 --> 00:10:29.924
 Eating a fucking stork.

107
00:10:30.446 --> 00:10:32.114
 Eating the stork.

108
00:10:34.513 --> 00:10:35.659
 Italia.

109
00:10:40.769 --> 00:10:42.542
 You okay, amigo?

110
00:10:42.542 --> 00:10:46.817
 Yeah. My ears are still ringing from earlier.

111
00:10:46.817 --> 00:10:50.570
 Well, a little Zen music
 won't bother you, then, will it?

112
00:11:11.738 --> 00:11:16.429
 Good morning.
 The time is 7:59 a. m.

113
00:11:38.327 --> 00:11:43.435
 British citizens, hold out
 your I.D. cards.
 All others, follow instructions.

114
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.924
 What the fuck?
 Move along! Move along!

115
00:12:16.282 --> 00:12:17.740
 This is him.

116
00:12:20.452 --> 00:12:22.329
 - Get your fucking head down!
 - Walk!

117
00:12:22.329 --> 00:12:25.353
 - Get your fucking head down!
 - Okay. Okay.

118
00:12:25.353 --> 00:12:28.898
 - Get in!
 - Get him in! Get him in!
 Get his fucking legs.

119
00:12:28.898 --> 00:12:30.461
 Go, go, go, go!

120
00:12:35.884 --> 00:12:38.178
 You are under the jurisdiction
 of the Fishes.

121
00:12:38.178 --> 00:12:40.055
 The Fishes are at war
 with the British government

122
00:12:40.055 --> 00:12:42.558
 until they recognize equal rights
 for every immigrant in Britain.

123
00:12:42.558 --> 00:12:47.250
 We're not gonna hurt you.
 We just want to talk.
 But don't do anything stupid.

124
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.169
 - Uncover him.
 - It isn't safe.
 Do it.

125
00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:04.975
 Hello, Theo.

126
00:13:06.853 --> 00:13:09.042
 It's me, Theo. It's Julian.

127
00:13:14.882 --> 00:13:20.825
 You scared the shit out of me.
 I'm sorry about the theatrics,
 but we had no choice.

128
00:13:20.825 --> 00:13:24.996
 The police have been
 a pain in the ass lately.
 How have you been?

129
00:13:24.996 --> 00:13:27.602
 Fantastic. Couldn't be better.

130
00:13:29.063 --> 00:13:30.626
 Cut the lights.

131
00:13:38.864 --> 00:13:42.826
 The police keep using
 that old photo of you in the posters.

132
00:13:42.826 --> 00:13:44.495
 It doesn't do you justice.

133
00:13:44.495 --> 00:13:47.727
 What do the police know about justice?
 What exactly is it you guys do, anyway?

134
00:13:47.727 --> 00:13:50.438
 The Fishes fight for equal rights
 for every immigrant in Britain!

135
00:13:50.438 --> 00:13:51.585
 He knows what we do.

136
00:13:51.585 --> 00:13:53.358
 I know you almost blew me up
 in a coffee shop yesterday.

137
00:13:53.358 --> 00:13:54.609
 My ears are still ringing.

138
00:13:54.609 --> 00:13:55.965
 - We don't bomb.
 - That was the government.

139
00:13:55.965 --> 00:13:57.216
 That's what they do to spread the fear.

140
00:13:57.216 --> 00:14:00.031
 What about Liverpool?
 After Liverpool,
 we stopped bombing.

141
00:14:00.031 --> 00:14:04.618
 We started speaking to the people.
 And they're joining us, Theo.
 British people, too.

142
00:14:05.245 --> 00:14:09.728
 I don't talk politics.
 - That's all you ever used to do.
 - That was
20 years ago.

143
00:14:09.728 --> 00:14:13.795
 I'm a lot more successful now.
 Come on, Theo. Walk with me.

144
00:14:13.795 --> 00:14:17.026
 - I don't think that's a good idea.
 - Come on!

145
00:14:24.118 --> 00:14:27.141
 - You're smoking?
 - Yeah. It's not working.

146
00:14:27.872 --> 00:14:30.582
 I heard about your mother. I'm sorry.

147
00:14:31.208 --> 00:14:32.877
 Were your parents in New York
 when it happened?

148
00:14:32.877 --> 00:14:34.858
 - Yeah.
 - Shit.

149
00:14:34.858 --> 00:14:38.924
 Yeah, well, that's the world we live in now,
 isn't it?

150
00:14:38.924 --> 00:14:42.782
 Why am I here, Jules?
 I need your help. I need transit papers.

151
00:14:42.782 --> 00:14:45.389
 Not for me. A girl, she's a fugee.

152
00:14:45.389 --> 00:14:48.517
 Need to get her to the coast,
 past security checkpoints.

153
00:14:48.517 --> 00:14:52.271
 I haven't seen you for nearly 20 years
 and you come asking me for transit papers?

154
00:14:52.271 --> 00:14:55.085
 - Can you do it?
 - I don't see how.

155
00:14:55.608 --> 00:14:56.755
 You could ask your cousin.

156
00:14:56.755 --> 00:15:00.613
 The government finances his
 Ark of the Arts. He has access to papers.

157
00:15:00.613 --> 00:15:05.929
 - Yeah, but he'd never do it.
 - He would if you asked him.
 I can't.
It's too dangerous.

158
00:15:09.059 --> 00:15:12.395
 I can get you £5,000.
 I know you need the money.

159
00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.567
 What are you talking about?

160
00:15:16.567 --> 00:15:20.007
 - I don't fucking need your money.
 - Right. Sorry.

161
00:15:21.051 --> 00:15:22.405
 My mistake.

162
00:15:28.975 --> 00:15:31.998
 You know that ringing in your ears? That...

163
00:15:33.563 --> 00:15:37.943
 That's the sound of the ear cells dying.
 Like their swan song.

164
00:15:37.943 --> 00:15:43.364
 Once it's gone,
 you'll never hear that frequency again.
 Enjoy it while it lasts.

165
00:15:46.284 --> 00:15:51.081
 This never fucking happened,
 so don't go telling tales,
 'cause we'll be watching you.

166
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:53.688
 At work, when you sleep,

167
00:15:53.688 --> 00:15:58.276
 when you have a piss, we'll be watching.
 All the fucking time.

168
00:15:58.276 --> 00:16:00.360
 Jeez, your breath stinks.

169
00:16:02.029 --> 00:16:03.593
 - No, it doesn't.
 - Yes, it does.

170
00:16:03.593 --> 00:16:07.139
 It was Julian's idea bringing you here.
 She put herself at great risk.

171
00:16:07.139 --> 00:16:10.684
 Now you know about the five grand
 we can offer you.
 So if you change your mind,

172
00:16:10.684 --> 00:16:14.749
 pin this to the notice board at Camden tube.
 We'll do the rest.

173
00:16:20.172 --> 00:16:22.153
 Here you are. Bus fare.

174
00:17:00.004 --> 00:17:02.819
 Earthquakes! Pollution!

175
00:17:02.819 --> 00:17:05.113
 Disease and famine!

176
00:17:05.113 --> 00:17:08.032
 Our sins have encouraged God's wrath!

177
00:17:09.597 --> 00:17:13.767
 And in his anger he has taken away
 his most precious gift to us!

178
00:17:50.888 --> 00:17:54.329
 Mr. Faron, the minister is expecting you.
 This way, sir.

179
00:17:54.329 --> 00:17:58.707
 I'm afraid this is a non-smoking facility.
 You got something in your
teeth.

180
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:08.926
 If you'll excuse me.

181
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:32.700
 Couldn't save La Pietà.
 Smashed up before we got there.

182
00:18:34.891 --> 00:18:36.663
 Pretty rummy, huh?

183
00:18:36.663 --> 00:18:39.582
 My mom had a plastic one in the bathroom.

184
00:18:40.313 --> 00:18:41.876
 It was a lamp.

185
00:18:42.815 --> 00:18:44.795
 Good to see you, Theo.

186
00:18:48.863 --> 00:18:52.617
 We got to keep Las Meninas
 and a few other Velásquezes,

187
00:18:52.617 --> 00:18:56.892
 but we only got a hold of two Goyas.
 That thing in Madrid was a real
blow to art.

188
00:18:56.892 --> 00:18:59.811
 Not to mention people.
 How's Martha?

189
00:18:59.811 --> 00:19:03.356
 She's doing her animal charity thing.
 Sends her love.

190
00:19:04.504 --> 00:19:06.692
 - Give her my best.
 - Yes.

191
00:19:10.864 --> 00:19:12.844
 Why did you come, Theo?

192
00:19:15.973 --> 00:19:17.745
 Well, the thing is,

193
00:19:19.414 --> 00:19:22.020
 I met this girl.
 Cute?

194
00:19:22.542 --> 00:19:23.898
 Beautiful.

195
00:19:23.898 --> 00:19:25.775
 Is it serious?

196
00:19:25.775 --> 00:19:26.921
 Very.

197
00:19:29.946 --> 00:19:33.387
 She's got this brother in Brighton and
 she hasn't seen him for about
five years,

198
00:19:33.387 --> 00:19:35.681
 and he's not doing too good.

199
00:19:35.681 --> 00:19:37.869
 I mean, pretty sick.

200
00:19:39.539 --> 00:19:42.980
 - I don't think he's gonna make it.
 - Sorry.

201
00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:46.419
 I've got money.
 I was just hoping that you might...

202
00:19:59.454 --> 00:20:02.791
 I was hoping you could get us
 the transit papers to get to the coast.

203
00:20:02.791 --> 00:20:06.649
 - Transit papers? That's quite a favor.
 - I know.

204
00:20:06.649 --> 00:20:08.421
 Highly controlled.

205
00:20:11.028 --> 00:20:13.530
 Alex, take your pills.

206
00:20:14.886 --> 00:20:15.928
 Alex.

207
00:20:17.285 --> 00:20:18.849
 Alex?

208
00:20:18.849 --> 00:20:19.995
 Alex!

209
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.488
 Come with me.

210
00:20:38.035 --> 00:20:42.518
 I'm really sorry, Nigel.
 I just don't know who else to ask.

211
00:20:42.518 --> 00:20:44.498
 I'll see what I can do.

212
00:20:47.315 --> 00:20:48.566
 What?

213
00:20:48.566 --> 00:20:50.025
 You kill me.

214
00:20:51.277 --> 00:20:55.343
 A hundred years from now,
 there won't be one sad fuck
 to look at any of this.

215
00:20:56.386 --> 00:20:58.262
 What keeps you going?

216
00:20:59.202 --> 00:21:03.267
 You know what it is, Theo?
 I just don't think about it.

217
00:21:11.818 --> 00:21:15.571
 - Where's Julian?
 - She couldn't make it. Sends her best.

218
00:21:17.241 --> 00:21:21.306
 Here's a photo of the girl and her name.
 Hang on. We got a problem.

219
00:21:22.558 --> 00:21:27.876
 All I could get were joint transit papers,
 which means I would have to escort the girl.

220
00:21:27.876 --> 00:21:29.126
 Will you?

221
00:21:30.066 --> 00:21:32.150
 For a couple more grand.

222
00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:37.989
 Julian thinks very highly of you.
 Does she?

223
00:21:38.929 --> 00:21:40.075
 Yeah.

224
00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:42.369
 Thanks again.

225
00:22:04.162 --> 00:22:06.352
 Go on, stay with her.

226
00:22:06.352 --> 00:22:10.001
 Stay with her. Stay with her. Yes!

227
00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.380
 Have you seen this dog?

228
00:22:27.311 --> 00:22:29.082
 I'll be one minute.

229
00:22:30.439 --> 00:22:32.941
 Billy! I'm in a rush, mate.

230
00:22:32.941 --> 00:22:37.528
 Okay, Theo. He'll see to you.
 He'll see to you.
 I'm in a rush. Come
on. Come on.

231
00:22:38.363 --> 00:22:39.926
 That's 70 quid.

232
00:22:55.464 --> 00:22:56.610
 Shit.

233
00:23:03.805 --> 00:23:07.976
 - She's my house cleaner.
 - He's the plumber.
 Jesus.

234
00:23:07.976 --> 00:23:11.625
 - He's my dentist.
 - He's the waiter.
 She's my cousin.

235
00:23:12.147 --> 00:23:17.882
 They are illegal immigrants.
 To hire, feed
 or shelter illegal immigrants is a crime.

236
00:23:17.882 --> 00:23:20.802
 Protect Britain.
 Report all illegal immigrants.

237
00:23:20.802 --> 00:23:24.346
 Did you get the papers?
 Lovely to see you, too.

238
00:23:24.868 --> 00:23:27.578
 Thank you. I really appreciate this.

239
00:23:28.622 --> 00:23:33.314
 Just like the old days, back of the bus.
 Yeah, except we're the old farts now.

240
00:23:33.314 --> 00:23:36.754
 - You're looking good.
 - Right.
 Seriously. Look at me.

241
00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:42.072
 It's hard for me to look at you.

242
00:23:42.594 --> 00:23:44.262
 He had your eyes.

243
00:23:51.353 --> 00:23:56.254
 You know, I never understood
 how you got over it so quickly.
 You think I got over it?

244
00:23:56.254 --> 00:23:58.756
 No one could get over it.
 I live with it. I think about him every day.

245
00:23:58.756 --> 00:24:00.008
 Come on, I mean the way you just...

246
00:24:00.008 --> 00:24:01.884
 You don't have a monopoly on suffering,
 you know.

247
00:24:01.884 --> 00:24:03.553
 You always carried his memory
 like a ball and chain...

248
00:24:03.553 --> 00:24:04.908
 What do you fucking know
 about my memories?

249
00:24:04.908 --> 00:24:07.828
 - You don't know what I feel or what...
 - Move!
 Yeah, there you go.

250
00:24:07.828 --> 00:24:11.790
 That's what you always do.
 When it gets tough, you walk away.

251
00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:13.457
 This is our stop.

252
00:24:25.971 --> 00:24:27.326
 Thelonius!

253
00:24:35.564 --> 00:24:37.753
 So why did you come to me?

254
00:24:38.379 --> 00:24:42.446
 You could have found other ways
 to get transit papers.
 Probably.

255
00:24:42.446 --> 00:24:44.739
 - So why me?
 - I trust you.

256
00:24:46.617 --> 00:24:49.745
 - And what happens after?
 - You take a train back. It'll be safer.

257
00:24:49.745 --> 00:24:52.142
 No, I mean what happens to us?

258
00:24:53.081 --> 00:24:54.540
 I don't know.

259
00:24:58.087 --> 00:25:01.215
 Theo, come on. You came for the money.

260
00:25:01.215 --> 00:25:02.465
 Did I?

261
00:25:15.604 --> 00:25:16.646
 Theo?

262
00:25:18.315 --> 00:25:20.922
 - You got my money?
 - See?

263
00:25:20.922 --> 00:25:24.050
 We'll take you down to the first checkpoint
 on the Canterbury Road,

264
00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:26.551
 then you and Kee are on your own.

265
00:25:30.411 --> 00:25:34.164
 Well, this is obviously the elite unit.
 - This is Miriam.
 - Hi.

266
00:25:34.164 --> 00:25:37.500
 - Is this the girl?
 - Kee, this is Theo.

267
00:25:40.212 --> 00:25:44.174
 What the fuck you staring at?
 Apparently the pleasure's all mine.

268
00:25:44.174 --> 00:25:46.571
 Are we planning a sing-along?

269
00:25:47.511 --> 00:25:50.430
 Good. I'm gonna take a nap.

270
00:25:59.606 --> 00:26:02.943
 The afternoon
 is looking good here on Radio Avalon.

271
00:26:02.943 --> 00:26:05.550
 And now one for all the nostalgics
 out there,

272
00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:08.782
 a blast from the past
 all the way back from 2003.

273
00:26:08.782 --> 00:26:14.099
 That beautiful time
 when people refused to accept
 the future was just around the corner.

274
00:26:15.247 --> 00:26:16.603
 Hey.

275
00:26:16.603 --> 00:26:18.166
 You're snoring.

276
00:26:18.688 --> 00:26:22.128
 - No, I wasn't.
 - Yes, you were. He always snored.

277
00:26:24.319 --> 00:26:25.778
 Where are we?

278
00:26:25.778 --> 00:26:28.280
 Canterbury. We're close.

279
00:26:29.532 --> 00:26:32.869
 Anyone know
 if there's a hotel around here?

280
00:26:32.869 --> 00:26:34.015
 What?

281
00:26:34.537 --> 00:26:38.707
 Julian promised me a little bit of action.
 You still like it in the afternoon?

282
00:26:40.064 --> 00:26:43.609
 So what did you do? Rob a train?
 Blow up a building?

283
00:26:43.609 --> 00:26:45.798
 Leave the girl alone.

284
00:26:45.798 --> 00:26:48.614
 You told me he was suave.
 Wanker's a drunk.

285
00:26:48.614 --> 00:26:52.368
 He's suave. You should have seen him
 in the old days when he was a real activist.

286
00:26:52.368 --> 00:26:54.766
 You were the activist,
 I just wanted to get laid.

287
00:26:54.766 --> 00:26:57.581
 One time the police came
 to throw us out of our squat

288
00:26:57.581 --> 00:27:03.107
 and Theo invited them up for coffee
 to negotiate,
 only the coffee was spiked with ketamine.

289
00:27:03.107 --> 00:27:05.609
 No! You didn't, did you?

290
00:27:07.487 --> 00:27:09.468
 Fuck off. You gotta be kidding.

291
00:27:09.468 --> 00:27:11.136
 You know how many people
 I've tried this with?

292
00:27:11.136 --> 00:27:12.179
 I don't wanna know.

293
00:27:12.179 --> 00:27:13.430
 You'll be happy to know
 out of the hundreds...

294
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:15.099
 - Hundreds?
 - ... you are still the only one.

295
00:27:15.099 --> 00:27:16.350
 - I'm not doing it.
 - Yes, you are.

296
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:20.520
 - No, I'm not. The car's moving too much.
 - Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
 You are. Ready?

297
00:27:23.023 --> 00:27:24.482
 Thelonius!

298
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:27.506
 No, wait, wait. Okay.

299
00:27:30.114 --> 00:27:32.198
 Do it again! Do it again!

300
00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:35.639
 Julian, that's disgusting!

301
00:27:39.394 --> 00:27:40.749
 Look out!

302
00:27:40.749 --> 00:27:42.313
 Jesus! Shit!

303
00:27:42.313 --> 00:27:44.712
 Go! Go! We're gonna make it.
 Come on, we're gonna make it.

304
00:27:44.712 --> 00:27:48.047
 No, I'm not gonna make it!
 I'm not gonna make it!

305
00:27:49.717 --> 00:27:52.948
 - Christ!
 - Back up! Back up now!
 Jesus!

306
00:27:57.745 --> 00:28:01.395
 Oh, save us!
 Save us in our hour of need!

307
00:28:01.395 --> 00:28:04.313
 Blessed Mary, save us.

308
00:28:17.661 --> 00:28:20.477
 Christ, Jesus!
 - He's got a gun!
 - Cover Kee!

309
00:28:20.477 --> 00:28:21.727
 Get down!

310
00:28:23.917 --> 00:28:28.400
 Oh, my God!
 She's been shot! Fuck. She's been shot.

311
00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:40.497
 - How is she? How is she?
 - She's bleeding!

312
00:28:40.497 --> 00:28:43.519
 She's bleeding, she's bleeding everywhere!

313
00:28:46.649 --> 00:28:48.525
 Shit! Julian.

314
00:28:48.525 --> 00:28:50.714
 Put pressure on the wound!

315
00:28:52.801 --> 00:28:56.346
 Please, please, please.

316
00:28:56.346 --> 00:28:59.057
 Please, please.

317
00:28:59.057 --> 00:29:00.203
 Oh, no.

318
00:29:01.246 --> 00:29:02.809
 Oh, no.

319
00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.939
 Julian...

320
00:29:05.939 --> 00:29:07.502
 Jesus Christ!

321
00:29:08.441 --> 00:29:10.005
 Julian!

322
00:29:10.005 --> 00:29:12.298
 It's the cops. It's the cops.

323
00:29:14.072 --> 00:29:15.739
 Did they see us?

324
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:17.721
 Keep going. Speed up.

325
00:29:17.721 --> 00:29:18.868
 Are they coming back?
 What's happening?

326
00:29:18.868 --> 00:29:21.995
 Faster! Faster!
 - Are they coming back?
 - I don't know. Just go faster!

327
00:29:22.935 --> 00:29:25.228
 Can't you pull off the road?

328
00:29:26.376 --> 00:29:29.400
 - All right, slow down. Slow down!
 - I can't outrun them. I can't outrun them.

329
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.798
 - Stop the car.
 - I gotta stop. I gotta stop.

330
00:29:31.798 --> 00:29:36.593
 Pull over to the side of the road.
 Stop the car!
 Get your passports
out!

331
00:29:38.158 --> 00:29:39.410
 Stay inside the vehicle!

332
00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.808
 We're British citizens!
 We're British citizens!

333
00:29:41.808 --> 00:29:43.268
 - British citizens!
 - Hands on the steering wheel!

334
00:29:43.268 --> 00:29:46.292
 Hands on the steering wheel!
 Calm down. Tell me what happened!

335
00:29:46.292 --> 00:29:48.168
 We were attacked!
 We gotta take her to a hospital.

336
00:29:48.168 --> 00:29:51.400
 Okay. Just wait.
 I'm gonna call for assistance.

337
00:29:52.756 --> 00:29:54.529
 What are you doing? What are you doing?

338
00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:58.074
 - Get in the car.
 - Why did you do that?
 Get in the fucking car!

339
00:29:58.074 --> 00:30:02.453
 Get back in now. Quickly.
 We gotta get off the road. Get in. Get in.

340
00:30:03.183 --> 00:30:05.164
 Go! Go! Go!

341
00:30:45.726 --> 00:30:49.062
 We have to call on help now.
 Put your hands out.

342
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:54.589
 Fucking shit.
 May all the ascended beings,
 the bodhisattvas and saints

343
00:30:54.589 --> 00:30:58.968
 and all those who have walked the surface
 of the earth in the light of eternal truth,

344
00:30:58.968 --> 00:31:02.825
 come to the aid
 of our beloved sister, Julian.

345
00:31:31.814 --> 00:31:34.107
 Theo! Come on!

346
00:31:47.454 --> 00:31:49.330
 Theo, come on!

347
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:36.669
 This is Tomasz and Emily's farm.
 I already called and told them the situation.

348
00:32:37.192 --> 00:32:38.963
 We'll be safe here.

349
00:32:43.239 --> 00:32:46.471
 Fishes are coming in
 to vote for a new leader.

350
00:32:51.164 --> 00:32:52.937
 - Ian?
 - Yeah.

351
00:32:52.937 --> 00:32:54.918
 - We have to convene.
 - Everyone's arriving.

352
00:32:54.918 --> 00:32:57.107
 - Are you all right?
 - Yeah, it's not my blood.

353
00:32:57.107 --> 00:33:00.653
 - Emily, Tomasz, this is Kee.
 - Welcome.

354
00:33:00.653 --> 00:33:01.904
 Miriam.

355
00:33:01.904 --> 00:33:05.762
 They need to wash up and rest.
 How about Julian's mate?

356
00:33:05.762 --> 00:33:09.099
 Yeah, can somebody
 give me a lift back to London?

357
00:33:09.099 --> 00:33:12.018
 No, no, no. It's too dangerous.
 We'll sort it tomorrow.

358
00:33:12.018 --> 00:33:14.104
 Tomasz, get him a shower and a clean shirt.

359
00:33:14.104 --> 00:33:17.752
 Tomasz, don't block the car in.
 It needs to be jump-started. Ian?
 Yeah.

360
00:33:18.587 --> 00:33:21.610
 They like you. And they don't like anyone.

361
00:33:48.826 --> 00:33:51.537
 - You did what you could.
 - We need to show strength and unity.

362
00:33:51.537 --> 00:33:56.125
 - The shirt fit?
 - Yeah, it's fine. Thanks.
 I'll take care of this.

363
00:33:56.125 --> 00:33:59.774
 As head Fishes,
 we need to make a choice now.
 We need to choose leadership.

364
00:33:59.774 --> 00:34:03.320
 I don't think
 that those bloodstains will wash off.

365
00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.030
 Don't worry about it. Throw it away.

366
00:34:13.017 --> 00:34:15.936
 - I'm in charge of watching you.
 - Why?

367
00:34:15.936 --> 00:34:17.395
 They told me.

368
00:34:17.917 --> 00:34:21.254
 Well, I'm going back to London tomorrow.

369
00:34:21.254 --> 00:34:24.486
 I lived there once. Didn't like it.

370
00:34:25.946 --> 00:34:27.092
 No.

371
00:34:28.032 --> 00:34:31.263
 They kill you.
 - Where you from?
 - Poland.

372
00:34:32.203 --> 00:34:36.164
 Is this your place?
 My missus. She's a cod.

373
00:34:37.625 --> 00:34:40.231
 - English Fish.
 - Mr. Faron.

374
00:34:40.231 --> 00:34:45.237
 Kee would like a word with you.
 She's in the barn. It's all right, Tomasz.

375
00:34:45.237 --> 00:34:46.800
 I'll watch him.

376
00:34:52.118 --> 00:34:54.411
 Hey, don't smoke in the barn.

377
00:34:58.062 --> 00:35:00.564
 To Luke, our new leader. Luke.

378
00:35:00.564 --> 00:35:02.336
 - To Luke.
 - Luke.

379
00:35:11.826 --> 00:35:13.806
 I'll be right outside.

380
00:35:18.082 --> 00:35:22.564
 You know what they do to these cows?
 They cut off their tits. They do.

381
00:35:24.234 --> 00:35:26.006
 Gone. Bye.

382
00:35:26.006 --> 00:35:29.134
 Only leave four. Four tits fits the machine.

383
00:35:29.864 --> 00:35:33.721
 It's wacko. Why not make machines
 that suck eight titties?

384
00:35:34.244 --> 00:35:39.979
 Is that what you want to talk about?
 Cows and titties?
 Julian told me about your baby.

385
00:35:39.979 --> 00:35:42.481
 Said his name was Dylan.

386
00:35:42.481 --> 00:35:46.965
 You taught him to swim when he was two.
 He called you "Papa. "

387
00:35:46.965 --> 00:35:50.197
 She said if anything goes spooky,
 I should talk to you.

388
00:35:50.197 --> 00:35:53.221
 Said you'd help me,
 said you'd get me to the boat.

389
00:35:53.221 --> 00:35:56.348
 - What boat?
 - The Tomorrow.
 The Tomorrow?

390
00:35:57.183 --> 00:36:01.771
 I don't know what you're talking about.
 But I'm sure
 your friends can take care of you.

391
00:36:01.771 --> 00:36:04.169
 But Julian said only trust you.

392
00:36:05.004 --> 00:36:08.131
 She said you'd help me.
 I don't know why she said that.

393
00:36:09.383 --> 00:36:11.469
 Listen, I don't quite know what's going on.

394
00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:14.075
 - You can't leave.
 - Kee, I'm in a lot of trouble myself.

395
00:36:14.075 --> 00:36:15.951
 - I'm sorry.
 - Wait!

396
00:36:16.995 --> 00:36:19.601
 What are you doing? Don't do that.

397
00:36:38.788 --> 00:36:40.142
 I'm scared.

398
00:36:45.878 --> 00:36:47.441
 Please help me.

399
00:36:53.281 --> 00:36:54.741
 Jesus Christ.

400
00:36:54.741 --> 00:36:57.243
 - Kee! Kee!
 - What are you doing?

401
00:36:59.016 --> 00:37:03.291
 - Are you all right?
 - She wanted him to know. She has the right.

402
00:37:03.291 --> 00:37:05.272
 Of course she has.

403
00:37:05.272 --> 00:37:09.235
 For God's sake.
 When you're ready, come inside.
 Everybody's arrived.

404
00:37:09.235 --> 00:37:12.570
 - She's pregnant.
 - Now you know what's at stake.

405
00:37:16.638 --> 00:37:19.348
 - But she's pregnant.
 - Yeah, I know.

406
00:37:20.809 --> 00:37:22.893
 It's a miracle, isn't it?

407
00:37:28.004 --> 00:37:31.757
 Fishes terrorist leader Julian Taylor
 was killed today

408
00:37:31.757 --> 00:37:34.468
 in a gun battle with police near Canterbury.

409
00:37:34.468 --> 00:37:38.325
 Four other terrorists escaped
 after murdering two officers.

410
00:37:38.848 --> 00:37:42.497
 Police say they have sufficient
 forensic and surveillance evidence

411
00:37:42.497 --> 00:37:44.374
 to identify the four killers.

412
00:37:44.374 --> 00:37:48.544
 All suspects should be considered armed
 and extremely dangerous.

413
00:37:49.483 --> 00:37:51.673
 This was broadcast an hour ago.

414
00:37:51.673 --> 00:37:55.531
 We have to assume it's just a matter of time
 before they identify the rest of us,

415
00:37:55.531 --> 00:37:58.346
 which includes you, Theo.
 - Why is he here?
 - He's not a Fish.

416
00:37:58.346 --> 00:38:02.413
 - He's not one of us.
 - I want him here.
 Kee wants him, he stays.

417
00:38:02.413 --> 00:38:06.062
 Now, we all agreed to deliver Kee to our
 brothers and sisters in the
Human Project.

418
00:38:06.062 --> 00:38:08.356
 - Right.
 - Now we got to reevaluate that position.

419
00:38:08.356 --> 00:38:12.840
 No, there's no need.
 We move forward with the original plan.
 Yes!

420
00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.030
 She'll never make it.
 The police are looking for her.

421
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:18.992
 We can find a way. It's what Julian wanted.
 We'd be risking the girl's life.

422
00:38:18.992 --> 00:38:21.599
 Listen, listen! She belongs here.

423
00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:23.684
 And this baby is the flag
 that could unite us all!

424
00:38:23.684 --> 00:38:26.187
 We said we'd never use this baby
 for political purposes.

425
00:38:26.187 --> 00:38:29.419
 My baby's not a flag.
 Make it public!

426
00:38:29.419 --> 00:38:30.775
 What?

427
00:38:30.775 --> 00:38:32.963
 - What?
 - What?
 Excuse me?

428
00:38:34.424 --> 00:38:37.031
 You should make it public.

429
00:38:37.031 --> 00:38:42.036
 You saw the telly.
 She's about to be very public.
 It doesn't matter. She's pregnant.

430
00:38:42.036 --> 00:38:46.937
 Oh, right. And then the government will say,
 "We were wrong. Fugees are humans, too. "

431
00:38:46.937 --> 00:38:48.084
 Well, whatever is going on,

432
00:38:48.084 --> 00:38:50.378
 whatever your political ideas are,
 it's irrelevant.

433
00:38:50.378 --> 00:38:51.837
 - It doesn't matter.
 - Come on.

434
00:38:51.837 --> 00:38:53.714
 - She needs a doctor.
 - You really don't get it.

435
00:38:53.714 --> 00:38:55.904
 Look, the government
 will take her baby

436
00:38:55.904 --> 00:38:57.989
 and parade a posh black English lady
 as the mother.

437
00:38:57.989 --> 00:38:59.971
 - And she'll never see it again.
 - Nobody's taking my baby!

438
00:38:59.971 --> 00:39:02.056
 We all know this government
 would never acknowledge

439
00:39:02.056 --> 00:39:05.393
 the first human birth in 18 years
 from a fugee.
 A wanted fugee.

440
00:39:05.393 --> 00:39:08.521
 Why don't we explain to Mr. Faron
 what they do to immigrants in this
country?

441
00:39:08.521 --> 00:39:13.317
 He knows. He's seen the cages.
 He's not that stupid.
 I'm not going to the government.

442
00:39:13.317 --> 00:39:15.403
 You told me
 you would get me to the Human Project.

443
00:39:15.403 --> 00:39:18.321
 - You promised me.
 - I know.
 And we will.

444
00:39:19.469 --> 00:39:23.327
 But I don't think it's safe
 to try and reach the coast now.

445
00:39:23.327 --> 00:39:27.810
 You could stay here, Kee.
 It's a safe place for you to have your child.

446
00:39:28.332 --> 00:39:29.792
 And when you and the baby
 are well enough,

447
00:39:29.792 --> 00:39:33.233
 we will find a way
 to get you to the Human Project.
 I promise you, Kee.

448
00:39:33.233 --> 00:39:37.090
 It could take months
 to get back in touch with them again.

449
00:39:37.612 --> 00:39:44.285
 This is true.
 We have to take it under consideration.
 Kee, this is your decision.

450
00:39:46.475 --> 00:39:48.247
 What do you think?

451
00:39:50.751 --> 00:39:54.609
 - I think you need proper care.
 - Oh, brilliant!
 She has proper care!

452
00:39:54.609 --> 00:39:58.050
 - What the fuck does he know?
 - Hang on. Kee?

453
00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:00.134
 Kee, this is your choice.

454
00:40:03.055 --> 00:40:06.287
 - I have my baby here...
 - Yes!
 ...then you get me to the Human Project.

455
00:40:06.287 --> 00:40:08.789
 Thank you, Kee. Thank you.

456
00:40:08.789 --> 00:40:11.918
 We need to organize safe houses.
 No more than three days in one place.

457
00:40:11.918 --> 00:40:14.523
 No, no,
 you can't keep moving her around.
 It's for her safety.

458
00:40:36.317 --> 00:40:38.715
 - Please help him!
 - What are you doing?

459
00:40:38.715 --> 00:40:40.592
 - He's hurt really badly!
 - Oh, shit, fuck.

460
00:40:40.592 --> 00:40:43.095
 - I didn't have anywhere else to go.
 - You're not supposed to be here!

461
00:40:43.095 --> 00:40:44.242
 There's fucking police everywhere!

462
00:40:44.242 --> 00:40:46.744
 - What do you think you're doing?
 - He's been bleeding for hours!

463
00:40:46.744 --> 00:40:49.975
 Shut up! Get his bike out of here.
 Get it out!

464
00:41:02.489 --> 00:41:07.077
 What was I supposed to do?
 It's a simple fucking plan.
 Get in here,
Patric!

465
00:41:07.077 --> 00:41:11.978
 What the fuck are you doing here?
 What the fuck are you doing here?
 No fucking excuses!

466
00:41:11.978 --> 00:41:14.584
 - You have a first aid kit? Medicine?
 - Mostly for cows.

467
00:41:14.584 --> 00:41:17.713
 lodine, bandages, clean towels,
 whatever you have, bring it to the barn.

468
00:41:17.713 --> 00:41:19.485
 And for God's sake,
 hide the fucking motorcycle.

469
00:41:19.485 --> 00:41:21.988
 - You put everything at risk.
 - What was I supposed to do?

470
00:41:21.988 --> 00:41:26.471
 What about all the fucking police, Ian?
 You said it would be safe!

471
00:41:26.471 --> 00:41:30.015
 We paid the gang.
 We had no idea about the cops.

472
00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:40.131
 You broke the protocol.
 What were you thinking?
 What was I thinking?

473
00:41:40.131 --> 00:41:42.529
 You could be responsible
 for putting the Uprising in jeopardy.

474
00:41:42.529 --> 00:41:45.449
 He needs a proper doctor!
 Don't you get it?

475
00:41:45.449 --> 00:41:50.037
 We have a baby.
 When people see we have a baby,
 everyone will join us in the Uprising.

476
00:41:50.037 --> 00:41:53.477
 But we can forget about the baby
 if the girl even suspects we killed
Julian!

477
00:41:53.477 --> 00:41:57.753
 What was I supposed to do?
 You saw how he is.
 He's on death's fucking door!

478
00:41:57.753 --> 00:42:00.671
 - Take it easy.
 - You broke protocol.
 He's my fucking cousin!

479
00:42:01.923 --> 00:42:04.426
 Luke, he needs a doctor.

480
00:42:04.426 --> 00:42:07.867
 Don't worry. We'll take care of him.
 Simon, right?

481
00:42:07.867 --> 00:42:11.204
 - Aye, Simon.
 - All right, sit down, Patric.

482
00:42:11.204 --> 00:42:13.602
 Simon is a good Fish. So are you.

483
00:42:13.602 --> 00:42:17.251
 Be proud to know that because
 of the two of you, the Uprising is assured.

484
00:42:17.251 --> 00:42:19.440
 The baby will stay with us.

485
00:42:20.379 --> 00:42:23.820
 Where's Faron? He's a fucking dead man.

486
00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:26.740
 No. Tomorrow. We'll do him then,
 after we move the girl.

487
00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:31.223
 Patric, you ever break protocol again,

488
00:42:32.788 --> 00:42:34.768
 I'll have to kill you.

489
00:42:46.447 --> 00:42:48.950
 Kee. Kee, it's Theo.

490
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:50.722
 - Listen to me.
 - What's going on?

491
00:42:50.722 --> 00:42:55.310
 Luke killed Julian.
 They want your baby. They killed Julian.

492
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:57.813
 They're gonna...
 They killed Julian. They're gonna kill me.

493
00:42:57.813 --> 00:43:01.358
 We have to leave. We have to go now.
 Miriam, shut up!

494
00:43:01.358 --> 00:43:03.860
 Trust me, we've got to go.

495
00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:06.363
 Stop it! Stop it! Both of you!

496
00:43:06.363 --> 00:43:07.823
 Get off!

497
00:43:07.823 --> 00:43:11.471
 I'm going with him.
 Miriam, you can stay if you want.

498
00:43:14.496 --> 00:43:18.353
 Miriam, you have to keep your mouth shut.
 - I mean it.
 - All right.
All right.

499
00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:42.961
 We're moving the girl
 to Bristol straight away.

500
00:43:44.109 --> 00:43:47.653
 We need to bring weapons over...

501
00:43:48.593 --> 00:43:51.303
 The refugee camps...

502
00:43:57.873 --> 00:44:00.584
 Zaphyr, he looks
 bloody fucking awful.
 Yeah. Really?

503
00:44:00.584 --> 00:44:03.921
 All that dirt and sand in there,
 nowhere to hide the blood in, no skin.

504
00:44:03.921 --> 00:44:06.632
 Shit! It's fucking disgusting.
 He's not gonna make it.

505
00:44:06.632 --> 00:44:11.010
 Of course not gonna make it,
 with all the blood and guts coming out.

506
00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:14.765
 Hey, Samir.

507
00:44:50.844 --> 00:44:52.094
 Shit.

508
00:45:04.607 --> 00:45:09.404
 Stop! Stop the car! Stop the fucking car!
 Don't shoot!

509
00:45:09.404 --> 00:45:12.428
 Don't shoot! The girl's in the car!

510
00:45:12.428 --> 00:45:14.409
 - Stop!
 - The girl's in the car!

511
00:45:14.409 --> 00:45:19.100
 Stop the fucking car!
 Give me the fucking keys.
 Give me the fucking
keys.

512
00:45:19.935 --> 00:45:22.125
 Get down! Get down!

513
00:45:22.125 --> 00:45:26.921
 Can't you get it moving any faster?
 For God's sake!
 Come on. Come on.

514
00:45:26.921 --> 00:45:30.466
 Stop!

515
00:45:30.466 --> 00:45:31.717
 Shit.

516
00:45:32.656 --> 00:45:35.053
 They're coming! They're coming!

517
00:45:35.576 --> 00:45:38.703
 Get going, get going!
 They're getting closer!

518
00:45:43.396 --> 00:45:45.689
 Oh, God! He's gaining on us!

519
00:45:46.211 --> 00:45:49.234
 Can I shoot? I got a clean shot!

520
00:45:49.757 --> 00:45:51.111
 Fuck off!

521
00:46:02.791 --> 00:46:06.126
 Miriam, jump-start the car!
 We have to go!

522
00:46:12.801 --> 00:46:17.075
 Wait till it gets faster!
 All right! All right! Just push, you push!

523
00:46:24.792 --> 00:46:26.250
 Fucking hell!

524
00:46:28.233 --> 00:46:30.110
 Miriam! Miriam!

525
00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:32.507
 We have to wait for him! Theo!

526
00:46:34.176 --> 00:46:35.948
 Go, go, go!

527
00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:51.277
 - Kee, are you all right?
 - I'm fine.
 We need to find a safe house.

528
00:46:51.277 --> 00:46:54.613
 Yeah, the last one was
 really fucking safe.
 Well, what do you suggest?

529
00:46:54.613 --> 00:46:57.115
 Don't worry. I know where to go.

530
00:47:22.454 --> 00:47:23.808
 Wait here.

531
00:47:27.041 --> 00:47:28.292
 Oh, fuck.

532
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.042
 Fuck.

533
00:47:53.005 --> 00:47:54.151
 Jasper?

534
00:47:55.195 --> 00:47:56.341
 Janice?

535
00:48:12.712 --> 00:48:13.858
 Jasper?

536
00:48:19.907 --> 00:48:22.617
 - Oh, fuck!
 - Oh, fuck you.

537
00:48:23.452 --> 00:48:30.230
 What are you doing with this shit?
 This? I mix it with bread to poison the rats.

538
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:34.818
 It's not bullshit what they say.
 They pass away quite peacefully.

539
00:48:34.818 --> 00:48:35.964
 Jasper.

540
00:48:36.799 --> 00:48:38.779
 Meet Miriam and Kee.

541
00:48:49.937 --> 00:48:53.691
 The Tomorrow is a hospital ship
 disguised as a fishing boat.

542
00:48:53.691 --> 00:48:58.591
 They'll take us to the Human Project.
 I told you, amigo, the Human Project is real.

543
00:48:58.591 --> 00:49:00.990
 Yeah, but you're also the guy
 that believes in UFOs.

544
00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:05.055
 Tell them about that thing
 you saw on the heath.
 You saw a UFO?

545
00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:09.331
 Did you know that the Human Project

546
00:49:09.331 --> 00:49:11.521
 is supposed to have
 a community on the Azores?

547
00:49:11.521 --> 00:49:16.422
 It's a sanctuary.
 That's where they'll take us, Kee.
 Can you catch this ship anywhere else?

548
00:49:16.422 --> 00:49:21.531
 It's going to stop at the last two
 weather buoys en route at sunset.

549
00:49:21.531 --> 00:49:25.493
 So it will be tonight at Windsmore
 and then two night's time at Bexhill.

550
00:49:25.493 --> 00:49:27.787
 You can forget about Windsmore.
 We'd never make it in time.

551
00:49:27.787 --> 00:49:29.768
 No, it's our only chance.
 We can't get to Bexhill.

552
00:49:29.768 --> 00:49:33.209
 That's a refugee camp.
 Eureka! Eat and rest.

553
00:49:33.209 --> 00:49:37.067
 With a little bit of luck,
 you're going to need all your energy.

554
00:49:37.067 --> 00:49:40.508
 - Where are you going?
 - Feed her for me, Theo.

555
00:49:40.508 --> 00:49:43.636
 Kee, your baby is the miracle

556
00:49:43.636 --> 00:49:46.346
 the whole world has been waiting for.

557
00:49:47.703 --> 00:49:50.100
 Come on. Come on.

558
00:49:52.812 --> 00:49:54.897
 Did he really see a UFO?

559
00:50:36.815 --> 00:50:39.212
 Is she doing her voodoo hoodoo?

560
00:50:41.298 --> 00:50:46.511
 She's doing something.
 She smited me with that.
 Said it was good for my baby.

561
00:50:48.597 --> 00:50:51.307
 Does she look posh to you, or gawky?

562
00:50:56.626 --> 00:50:57.876
 Earnest.

563
00:50:59.233 --> 00:51:00.587
 Yeah.

564
00:51:02.882 --> 00:51:05.489
 - How many months?
 - Eight.

565
00:51:05.489 --> 00:51:07.470
 It takes nine months.

566
00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:08.616
 I know.

567
00:51:09.556 --> 00:51:11.223
 Who's the father?

568
00:51:12.475 --> 00:51:14.978
 Whiffet. I'm a virgin.

569
00:51:14.978 --> 00:51:16.332
 Sorry?

570
00:51:21.026 --> 00:51:24.049
 That'd be wicked, eh?
 Yeah, it would.

571
00:51:24.049 --> 00:51:27.594
 Fuck knows.
 I don't know most of the wankers' names.

572
00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:32.078
 You know, when I started puking,
 I thought I catch the pest.

573
00:51:32.078 --> 00:51:34.893
 But then my belly started getting big.

574
00:51:35.936 --> 00:51:40.420
 Nobody ever told me these things.
 I never seen a pregnant woman before.

575
00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:41.774
 But I knew.

576
00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:44.904
 I felt like a freak.

577
00:51:44.904 --> 00:51:46.779
 I didn't tell nobody.

578
00:51:48.449 --> 00:51:52.620
 I thought about the Quietus thing.
 Supposed to be suave.

579
00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:54.808
 Pretty music and all that.

580
00:51:57.312 --> 00:51:59.188
 Then the baby kicked.

581
00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:04.611
 I feel it. Little bastard was alive.
 And I feel it. And me, too.

582
00:52:04.611 --> 00:52:06.174
 I am alive.

583
00:52:11.493 --> 00:52:14.098
 - Froley.
 - Froley.

584
00:52:16.081 --> 00:52:17.957
 Name my baby Froley.

585
00:52:18.583 --> 00:52:21.607
 It's the first baby in 18 years.

586
00:52:21.607 --> 00:52:26.508
 - You can't call it Froley.
 - Says who?
 Kee, I've found you a boat.

587
00:52:26.508 --> 00:52:27.655
 - Great.
 - How?

588
00:52:27.655 --> 00:52:29.949
 We get ourselves arrested.
 - Oh, Jesus.
 - No, no.

589
00:52:29.949 --> 00:52:34.015
 Syd, this border guard I sell pot to,
 has agreed to get us into Bexhill.

590
00:52:34.015 --> 00:52:37.038
 Nicely ironic, eh? We break into prison!

591
00:52:39.959 --> 00:52:41.313
 Wicked.

592
00:53:15.932 --> 00:53:17.287
 "Froley. "

593
00:53:19.477 --> 00:53:20.728
 Come on.

594
00:53:27.298 --> 00:53:31.468
 Everything is a mythical
 cosmic battle

595
00:53:32.199 --> 00:53:35.117
 between faith and chance.

596
00:53:35.848 --> 00:53:39.601
 - Maybe I shouldn't.
 - You already did. Take another one.

597
00:53:41.791 --> 00:53:43.146
 Now cough.

598
00:53:45.649 --> 00:53:48.256
 - What do you taste?
 - Strawberries.

599
00:53:48.256 --> 00:53:52.009
 Strawberries? That's what it's called.
 Strawberry Cough.

600
00:53:52.636 --> 00:53:53.783
 Wicked.

601
00:53:53.783 --> 00:53:58.162
 So, you've got faith over here, right,
 and chance over there.

602
00:53:58.162 --> 00:54:02.124
 - Like yin and yang.
 - Sort of.
 Or Shiva and Shakti.

603
00:54:02.124 --> 00:54:04.314
 Lennon and McCartney.

604
00:54:04.314 --> 00:54:05.982
 Look, Julian and Theo.

605
00:54:05.982 --> 00:54:11.821
 Yeah, there you go. Julian and Theo met
 among a million protestors in a rally
 by chance.

606
00:54:11.821 --> 00:54:14.533
 But they were there
 because of what they believed in

607
00:54:14.533 --> 00:54:18.286
 in the first place, their faith.
 They wanted to change the world.

608
00:54:18.286 --> 00:54:21.310
 And their faith kept them together.

609
00:54:21.310 --> 00:54:24.960
 But by chance, Dylan was born.

610
00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:26.628
 This is him?

611
00:54:26.628 --> 00:54:31.111
 Yeah, that's him. He would have been
 about your age. Magical child.

612
00:54:32.154 --> 00:54:33.509
 Beautiful.

613
00:54:34.344 --> 00:54:36.847
 - Their faith put in praxis.
 - Praxis?

614
00:54:36.847 --> 00:54:39.035
 - What happened?
 - Chance.

615
00:54:39.766 --> 00:54:44.770
 He was their sweet little dream.
 He had little hands, little legs, little feet.

616
00:54:46.439 --> 00:54:48.107
 Little lungs.

617
00:54:48.733 --> 00:54:52.903
 And in 2008, along came the flu pandemic.

618
00:54:55.407 --> 00:54:57.283
 And then, by chance,

619
00:54:57.805 --> 00:55:00.098
 - he was gone.
 - Oh, Jesus.

620
00:55:01.976 --> 00:55:04.582
 You see, Theo's faith

621
00:55:05.417 --> 00:55:07.501
 lost out to chance.

622
00:55:08.753 --> 00:55:10.004
 So,

623
00:55:10.839 --> 00:55:15.635
 why bother
 if life's going to make its own choices?

624
00:55:15.635 --> 00:55:18.555
 - Watcha! Baby's got Theo's eyes.
 - Yeah.

625
00:55:18.555 --> 00:55:23.768
 Oh, boy. That's terrible.
 But, you know,
 everything happens for a reason.

626
00:55:23.768 --> 00:55:28.668
 That I don't know.
 But Theo and Julian would always
 bring Dylan. He
loved it here.

627
00:55:42.954 --> 00:55:47.229
 It's the alarm!
 Someone's breaking in!
 What is it?

628
00:55:47.229 --> 00:55:48.688
 Look at this.

629
00:55:51.817 --> 00:55:53.068
 Shit.

630
00:56:01.202 --> 00:56:03.078
 Jasper, hurry up!

631
00:56:05.685 --> 00:56:06.937
 Where's Janice?

632
00:56:06.937 --> 00:56:10.378
 Take the back path to the main road,
 then follow the map I've given Miriam.

633
00:56:10.378 --> 00:56:11.733
 - Yeah, I've got it.
 - What are you talking about?

634
00:56:11.733 --> 00:56:15.278
 Wait for Syd at the old school
 on Watchbell Road in Rye.

635
00:56:15.278 --> 00:56:17.364
 Give him this, and tell him he's a fascist pig.

636
00:56:17.364 --> 00:56:20.699
 - We need to get Janice.
 - We're not going, Theo.

637
00:56:21.743 --> 00:56:24.663
 - What are you talking about?
 - You don't need an anchor.

638
00:56:24.663 --> 00:56:27.478
 - No, Jasper. You're coming.
 - You need time. We'll stall them.

639
00:56:27.478 --> 00:56:31.439
 I'll send them the wrong way.
 It's the best idea. Go on. Go on.
 Jasper.

640
00:56:31.962 --> 00:56:36.237
 Theo, I've talked my way out of
 worse things than this. Believe me.

641
00:56:36.237 --> 00:56:37.800
 Go on. Go.

642
00:56:39.782 --> 00:56:43.952
 And remember, tell Syd he's a fascist pig.

643
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:27.224
 I love you.

644
00:58:17.901 --> 00:58:19.464
 Hey, amigos!

645
00:58:20.612 --> 00:58:25.200
 We're looking for Theo Faron.
 We know he was here a few weeks ago.
 Has he been back?

646
00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:28.641
 - Who?
 - Theo Faron.
 I haven't seen him in weeks.

647
00:58:28.641 --> 00:58:31.456
 There's biscuits and coffee on inside!
 Help yourself.

648
00:58:31.456 --> 00:58:35.313
 You want a drag?
 Come on, have a drag. Lighten up.

649
00:58:36.566 --> 00:58:38.858
 - What we got?
 - Here, Luke.

650
00:58:39.902 --> 00:58:43.446
 There's a dead woman and dog inside.
 They're going to Bexhill.

651
00:58:44.282 --> 00:58:46.157
 When did they leave?

652
00:58:47.305 --> 00:58:49.286
 When did they leave?

653
00:58:51.893 --> 00:58:53.979
 Pull my finger, go on.

654
00:58:53.979 --> 00:58:55.542
 Pull my finger.

655
00:58:56.481 --> 00:58:57.836
 I'll do it.

656
00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:05.969
 Fuck you.

657
00:59:17.127 --> 00:59:18.690
 Pull my finger.

658
00:59:24.947 --> 00:59:28.387
 - Theo, I'm so sorry.
 - Don't you fucking touch me.

659
00:59:29.431 --> 00:59:34.123
 You tell me the fucking reason in that.
 - It's all part of a bigger thing.
 - Shut up!

660
00:59:34.123 --> 00:59:36.834
 Shut up and get in the fucking car.

661
00:59:36.834 --> 00:59:38.919
 - Jasper?
 - He's fine.

662
00:59:40.796 --> 00:59:42.568
 Everything's fine.

663
01:01:47.903 --> 01:01:51.761
 I was 31.
 Midwife at the John Radcliffe.

664
01:01:51.761 --> 01:01:54.888
 I was doing a stint in the antenatal clinic.

665
01:01:55.515 --> 01:01:58.642
 Three of my patients
 miscarried in one week.

666
01:01:59.164 --> 01:02:04.690
 Others were in their fifth and sixth month.
 We managed to save two of the poor babies.

667
01:02:04.690 --> 01:02:07.713
 Next week, five more miscarried.

668
01:02:08.236 --> 01:02:11.571
 Then the miscarriages
 started happening earlier.

669
01:02:12.407 --> 01:02:15.118
 I remember booking a woman in
 for her next appointment

670
01:02:15.118 --> 01:02:20.226
 and noticing that the page
 seven months ahead was completely blank.
 Not a single name.

671
01:02:21.374 --> 01:02:24.189
 I rang a friend
 who was working at Queen Charlotte's,

672
01:02:24.189 --> 01:02:27.003
 and she had no new pregnancies, either.

673
01:02:28.047 --> 01:02:31.070
 She then rang her sister in Sydney.

674
01:02:32.322 --> 01:02:34.824
 And it was the same thing there.

675
01:02:38.161 --> 01:02:40.559
 You can relax. She's finished.

676
01:02:44.626 --> 01:02:47.441
 As the sound of the playgrounds faded,

677
01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:50.152
 the despair set in.

678
01:02:55.053 --> 01:02:59.015
 Very odd what happens in a world
 without children's voices.

679
01:03:01.622 --> 01:03:03.603
 I was there at the end.

680
01:03:05.063 --> 01:03:08.192
 Now you're gonna be there at the beginning.

681
01:03:08.192 --> 01:03:09.337
 Yeah.

682
01:03:09.964 --> 01:03:12.361
 I'll be there at the beginning.

683
01:03:13.301 --> 01:03:14.655
 Thank you.

684
01:03:18.619 --> 01:03:21.537
 Kee, come on! We've got to go!

685
01:03:32.174 --> 01:03:34.155
 Stop where you are.

686
01:03:34.155 --> 01:03:36.135
 I'm looking for Syd.

687
01:03:38.013 --> 01:03:39.993
 Hands above your head.

688
01:03:42.392 --> 01:03:44.477
 You're a fascist pig.

689
01:03:58.033 --> 01:03:59.700
 What did you say?

690
01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:03.767
 I was told to tell you you're a fascist pig.

691
01:04:05.958 --> 01:04:08.876
 - Say it again.
 - No, don't, please!

692
01:04:09.503 --> 01:04:10.962
 Say it again.

693
01:04:11.693 --> 01:04:13.151
 Say it!

694
01:04:14.195 --> 01:04:16.071
 You're a fascist pig.

695
01:04:24.935 --> 01:04:26.185
 Come on.

696
01:04:34.945 --> 01:04:38.594
 It was Jasper's idea, you know.
 The whole password thing.

697
01:04:38.594 --> 01:04:42.347
 He will piss himself laughing
 when I tell him about this.

698
01:04:42.974 --> 01:04:45.581
 He's a cheeky old bastard.

699
01:04:45.581 --> 01:04:47.875
 So proud of his weed.

700
01:04:47.875 --> 01:04:52.879
 Syd could get it a lot cheaper from
 the gangs, but Syd likes to deal
with Jasper.

701
01:04:53.505 --> 01:04:56.215
 Jasper's straight. A true gentleman.

702
01:04:57.363 --> 01:05:01.220
 - All right.
 - What's wrong with her? Is she sick?
 Just carsick.

703
01:05:01.743 --> 01:05:05.704
 - She's not going to puke, is she?
 - No. She's fine.
 Puking's bad. Very, very bad.

704
01:05:06.226 --> 01:05:09.458
 It doesn't wash out.
 The smell never goes away.

705
01:05:10.189 --> 01:05:14.254
 Usually, there's people trying
 to get out of Bexhill, not in.

706
01:05:15.715 --> 01:05:18.633
 Syd doesn't know why you want to get in.

707
01:05:19.364 --> 01:05:21.449
 Syd doesn't want to know.

708
01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:24.056
 Syd doesn't care.

709
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:28.018
 Just breathe. Just breathe.

710
01:05:28.645 --> 01:05:32.502
 What's wrong with her?
 A minor contraction.
 It's normal. Just breathe.

711
01:05:33.441 --> 01:05:34.797
 All right.

712
01:05:34.797 --> 01:05:38.967
 When you're released,
 stroll out with the other fugees.
 Look for the statue of a soldier.

713
01:05:38.967 --> 01:05:42.721
 There you'll meet a woman, Marichka.
 Arab, gypsy, something.

714
01:05:42.721 --> 01:05:47.205
 Always carries a shitty little dog with her.
 She'll find you accommodation for tonight.

715
01:05:47.205 --> 01:05:49.706
 All right. You're fugees now.

716
01:05:50.854 --> 01:05:53.044
 Show Syd the fugee face.

717
01:05:53.044 --> 01:05:54.712
 Sad face.

718
01:05:54.712 --> 01:05:56.380
 Sad fugee face.

719
01:05:57.215 --> 01:05:59.404
 That's good. That's good.

720
01:05:59.404 --> 01:06:01.697
 Okay. Out!

721
01:06:06.391 --> 01:06:08.579
 Come on. Come on. Come on.

722
01:06:12.438 --> 01:06:14.731
 Hurry up. Hurry up, move.

723
01:06:31.311 --> 01:06:35.064
 Send me a postcard.
 Seats in the back!
 Come on, hurry up!

724
01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:24.802
 What time
 are we supposed to meet the boat?
 Sunset tomorrow.

725
01:07:24.802 --> 01:07:28.765
 How do we know that Luke and his mob
 haven't intercepted it?

726
01:07:28.765 --> 01:07:33.247
 Luke has no way of contacting
 the Human Project. Nor does anyone else.

727
01:07:35.647 --> 01:07:37.210
 Say again?

728
01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:43.570
 Contact with the Human Project
 is done by mirrors.
 Julian was our mirror.

729
01:07:44.927 --> 01:07:47.220
 What do you mean, "mirrors"?

730
01:07:48.159 --> 01:07:51.287
 Mirrors. They contact one of our people.

731
01:07:51.287 --> 01:07:56.188
 That person contacts someone else,
 and so on, till word gets to Julian.
 She tells Luke.

732
01:07:56.188 --> 01:07:58.586
 You mean you never
 actually talked to any of them?

733
01:07:58.586 --> 01:08:02.757
 Don't fucking tell me
 you never actually talked to them?

734
01:08:02.757 --> 01:08:07.240
 - Breathe it out.
 - Is she okay?
 That's it. Breathe it out, breathe
it out.

735
01:08:08.179 --> 01:08:10.577
 I can't fucking breathe.

736
01:08:10.577 --> 01:08:12.871
 You sure this is normal?

737
01:08:12.871 --> 01:08:15.582
 It shouldn't be this frequent.

738
01:08:15.582 --> 01:08:18.814
 Come on, breathe it out. All right, all right.

739
01:08:45.195 --> 01:08:46.864
 Miriam,

740
01:08:46.864 --> 01:08:48.427
 I'm all wet.

741
01:08:49.053 --> 01:08:53.224
 Her water's broke. The baby's coming.
 Shit. Shit!

742
01:08:53.224 --> 01:08:57.604
 All right, sweetheart. All right, sweetheart.
 Everything is fine. Breathe.

743
01:08:57.604 --> 01:09:03.026
 Just breathe it out. That's it.
 Tomorrow you'll be safe.
 You'll be on the boat.

744
01:09:03.026 --> 01:09:08.030
 On the Tomorrow, they'll take care of you.
 They'll take you far away
from all this.

745
01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:21.272
 Look up, you piece of shite. Look up.

746
01:09:22.629 --> 01:09:23.880
 Out!

747
01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:25.444
 Get out!

748
01:09:25.444 --> 01:09:28.468
 Lord, give Kee the strength to know
 that she has the power already within her.

749
01:09:28.468 --> 01:09:30.136
 - She has the wisdom...
 - What's wrong with you?

750
01:09:30.136 --> 01:09:33.994
 I said, what's wrong with you?
 Look at me!
 I said, what's wrong with you?

751
01:09:33.994 --> 01:09:37.018
 - Saint Gabriel, help us...
 - Shut up!

752
01:09:37.018 --> 01:09:42.336
 - You! Out!
 - Saint Gabriel, come to our aid!
 Listen, you fucking nutcase! Get out!

753
01:09:42.336 --> 01:09:48.071
 - Up, now. Come on.
 - Caca! Caca!
 Piss. Piss. Caca. Smell. Girl.

754
01:09:48.071 --> 01:09:52.970
 You smell it yourself.
 You fucking people disgust me.

755
01:10:02.669 --> 01:10:05.901
 She's okay, Kee. She's okay.

756
01:10:05.901 --> 01:10:08.194
 - She's gonna be...
 - Miriam!

757
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:27.276
 Move it! Come along now!

758
01:10:33.324 --> 01:10:38.747
 Come on, shift it! Shift it! You!
 Get down there. Down there. Move.

759
01:10:38.747 --> 01:10:40.414
 Follow the line!

760
01:10:45.107 --> 01:10:46.358
 - Theo!
 - Kee!

761
01:10:46.358 --> 01:10:48.338
 - Take it off!
 - Theo!

762
01:10:53.032 --> 01:10:55.951
 Come on, move! Move it! Come on!

763
01:10:55.951 --> 01:10:57.932
 Move it! Move it!

764
01:10:57.932 --> 01:11:00.331
 Come on! Move! Move!

765
01:11:00.331 --> 01:11:03.563
 Britain supports you
 and provides you shelter.

766
01:11:03.563 --> 01:11:05.961
 Do not support terrorists.

767
01:11:05.961 --> 01:11:11.278
 Britain supports you
 and provides you shelter.
 Do not support terrorists.

768
01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:20.559
 Hey you, buddy!
 Buddy, buddy, welcome to paradise!

769
01:11:20.559 --> 01:11:25.460
 You want accommodations?
 I got running water! I got...
 Just leave the girl alone.

770
01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:28.171
 - Who the fuck are you to tell me what to do?
 - Fuck off.

771
01:11:28.171 --> 01:11:29.944
 - Who do you fucking think you are?
 - Fuck off.

772
01:11:29.944 --> 01:11:31.925
 Don't mind these bastards.
 I'll take care of you.

773
01:11:31.925 --> 01:11:34.427
 Come on, I've got a room, food,
 a place to stay. What do you need?

774
01:11:34.427 --> 01:11:37.763
 - I'm fine, thanks.
 - You must need something, man.
 "Fuck off," is it? Bollocks.

775
01:11:49.442 --> 01:11:50.797
 Marichka?

776
01:12:02.476 --> 01:12:04.040
 It's okay, Kee.

777
01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:07.167
 Just breathe through it.

778
01:12:08.211 --> 01:12:11.755
 That's it. It's okay. We're almost there, Kee.

779
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:14.362
 We're almost there.

780
01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:29.690
 It's just a few stairs.

781
01:12:30.838 --> 01:12:32.609
 Just hold onto me.

782
01:12:33.757 --> 01:12:35.633
 I've got you.

783
01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:38.136
 Just keep breathing.

784
01:12:39.075 --> 01:12:41.264
 Marichka? How far?

785
01:12:41.786 --> 01:12:43.455
 How far?

786
01:12:43.455 --> 01:12:46.269
 We're almost there, Kee. Almost there.

787
01:12:47.313 --> 01:12:49.606
 You're doing great. Come on.

788
01:12:51.901 --> 01:12:54.819
 You're almost there. Three more steps.

789
01:13:04.413 --> 01:13:06.810
 We're there, Kee. We're there.

790
01:13:16.301 --> 01:13:19.324
 Okay, there's a bed. Easy.

791
01:13:20.576 --> 01:13:23.182
 Make her go! Make her go!

792
01:13:26.728 --> 01:13:28.918
 That's great. Thank you.

793
01:13:28.918 --> 01:13:32.462
 Get her out!

794
01:13:39.553 --> 01:13:40.908
 Thank you.

795
01:13:53.109 --> 01:13:54.777
 Okay, Kee.

796
01:13:54.777 --> 01:13:58.425
 I'm going to put my coat underneath.
 You'll be cleaner.

797
01:14:02.389 --> 01:14:03.848
 You're okay.

798
01:14:05.517 --> 01:14:07.081
 Okay?

799
01:14:07.081 --> 01:14:10.312
 There's water.
 I'm just going to wash my hands.

800
01:14:14.276 --> 01:14:17.507
 - Theo! Theo!
 - I'm here. Fuck!

801
01:14:18.134 --> 01:14:20.741
 It's okay. Everything's okay.

802
01:14:20.741 --> 01:14:22.304
 Do something!

803
01:14:26.788 --> 01:14:30.125
 It's looking good, Kee. It's looking good.

804
01:14:30.125 --> 01:14:33.357
 You're doing great. Just keep breathing.

805
01:14:33.357 --> 01:14:35.547
 - Keep breathing.
 - I am breathing!

806
01:14:35.547 --> 01:14:40.342
 No, like Miriam said. Do you remember?
 Breathe out. Just think about
the out.

807
01:14:41.490 --> 01:14:44.618
 Breathe out and push. Push as well.

808
01:14:45.244 --> 01:14:47.955
 - That's it. That's it!
 - I can't!

809
01:14:47.955 --> 01:14:51.396
 Yes, you can. Yes, you can.
 Just out and push.

810
01:14:51.396 --> 01:14:53.063
 Out and push.

811
01:14:54.316 --> 01:14:56.818
 - That's it!
 - I can't do it, Theo. Stop it, please.

812
01:14:56.818 --> 01:15:00.155
 Kee, I can see the head. I can see the head.

813
01:15:00.155 --> 01:15:04.429
 You're doing great. You're doing great, Kee.
 That's it. That's it.

814
01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:10.478
 It's coming again.
 Just breathe out and push. Out and push.

815
01:15:10.478 --> 01:15:12.355
 - That's it. Out and...
 - I can't.

816
01:15:12.355 --> 01:15:14.649
 - You can. Yes, you can.
 - I fucking can't!

817
01:15:14.649 --> 01:15:18.924
 - Yes, you fucking can! Come on!
 - I can't do it.
 Kee, the head's coming out.

818
01:15:18.924 --> 01:15:23.303
 That's it, you're nearly there!
 You're nearly there. Just push!

819
01:15:23.303 --> 01:15:25.910
 Push, Kee! Push!

820
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:27.264
 Push!

821
01:15:35.607 --> 01:15:37.274
 Oh, my God.

822
01:15:39.152 --> 01:15:40.611
 How is he?

823
01:15:41.759 --> 01:15:43.322
 It's a girl.

824
01:15:45.096 --> 01:15:47.493
 Kee, you've got a girl.

825
01:15:54.793 --> 01:15:56.460
 Hey, baba.

826
01:16:04.282 --> 01:16:08.868
 - Aren't we supposed to cut the cord?
 - Yeah, it's okay. There's no rush.

827
01:16:09.704 --> 01:16:11.267
 You've done it.

828
01:16:12.832 --> 01:16:14.082
 Kee,

829
01:16:15.230 --> 01:16:16.585
 see?

830
01:16:17.524 --> 01:16:19.296
 It wasn't that bad.

831
01:16:20.131 --> 01:16:22.111
 Oh, yeah, not for you.

832
01:16:39.838 --> 01:16:43.279
 Come on! Hurry up!
 We don't have much time!

833
01:16:43.279 --> 01:16:44.947
 Who is it?

834
01:16:44.947 --> 01:16:48.804
 The King of England.
 Open the door, you asshole. It's Syd.

835
01:16:54.436 --> 01:16:57.459
 How can you sleep through
 when the whole city's going to hell?

836
01:16:57.981 --> 01:17:02.882
 - What's wrong with her?
 - She's fine. It's a woman's thing.
 Fuck off!

837
01:17:02.882 --> 01:17:06.740
 A few hours ago, a bomb blew a hole
 in the fence and fugees got out.

838
01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:10.702
 But Syd happens to know,
 the hole in the fence
 isn't about fugees getting out.

839
01:17:10.702 --> 01:17:12.579
 - It's about Fishies getting in.
 - Go away.

840
01:17:12.579 --> 01:17:16.124
 Syd also happens to know that the Army's
 gonna blow the shit out of this place.

841
01:17:16.124 --> 01:17:20.817
 But don't worry. Syd is here to get you out.
 Fuck off. Go away. Go on. Piss off!

842
01:17:20.817 --> 01:17:22.692
 Get your fucking dog.

843
01:17:29.054 --> 01:17:32.599
 What you got there?
 - Nothing.
 - Nothing?

844
01:17:32.599 --> 01:17:34.266
 - Nothing.
 - No?

845
01:17:35.310 --> 01:17:38.333
 - Like to show me?
 - I don't have anything.

846
01:17:39.272 --> 01:17:43.442
 - It's nothing.
 - Well, if it's nothing, then I can have a look.

847
01:17:44.799 --> 01:17:47.092
 - It's nothing.
 - Let me see.

848
01:17:47.927 --> 01:17:51.471
 - No.
 - Let me see.
 It's okay. Let me see.

849
01:17:53.245 --> 01:17:54.704
 Jesus Christ.

850
01:17:55.539 --> 01:17:57.206
 Jesus Christ.

851
01:17:58.041 --> 01:18:00.648
 - That's a...
 - That's right.

852
01:18:00.648 --> 01:18:02.315
 We got a baby.

853
01:18:02.942 --> 01:18:06.590
 And now we need a rowboat.
 Can you help us?

854
01:18:07.947 --> 01:18:11.179
 Get her up. Get her up. We need to go.
 Can you help us get a boat?

855
01:18:11.179 --> 01:18:15.767
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just get her up.
 We need to go. We need to go now.

856
01:18:15.767 --> 01:18:19.104
 - What's she saying?
 - Fuck knows.
 Bad! Bad! Bad!

857
01:18:19.104 --> 01:18:21.918
 - She doesn't want us to go.
 - Shut up.

858
01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:26.923
 We need to go.

859
01:18:29.218 --> 01:18:33.076
 Syd was watching television last night
 with Mommy.

860
01:18:33.076 --> 01:18:37.039
 She's a sweet old soul.
 Dying of cancer. It's heartbreaking.

861
01:18:37.039 --> 01:18:40.897
 And then the news came on,
 and you two were on it.

862
01:18:40.897 --> 01:18:43.191
 Something about a cop killer.

863
01:18:43.191 --> 01:18:45.796
 Something about a big reward.

864
01:18:46.736 --> 01:18:49.864
 Syd then finds out
 the Fishes are looking for you.

865
01:18:49.864 --> 01:18:54.452
 So Syd thinks,
 "If the Fishes are looking for you,
 "and the coppers
are looking for you,

866
01:18:54.452 --> 01:18:59.664
 "you people are first class commodities. "
 Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

867
01:19:00.291 --> 01:19:02.585
 Down, down, down!

868
01:19:02.585 --> 01:19:05.086
 Now, Syd has a baby.

869
01:19:18.330 --> 01:19:20.519
 Bad! Bad! Bad!

870
01:19:22.084 --> 01:19:23.334
 Marichka!

871
01:19:24.273 --> 01:19:28.443
 I'll fucking kill you, you bitch!
 I'll fucking kill you!

872
01:19:33.762 --> 01:19:35.429
 Bitch. You bitch.

873
01:19:38.246 --> 01:19:41.894
 Baby! Marichka baby!
 Quick, quick. The baby!

874
01:19:44.189 --> 01:19:46.691
 My baby! She took...

875
01:19:47.839 --> 01:19:50.653
 I'll fucking kill you, you gypsy bitch!

876
01:19:57.536 --> 01:20:00.350
 I'm gonna blow your fucking brains out.

877
01:20:02.437 --> 01:20:04.312
 Go, go!

878
01:20:20.893 --> 01:20:23.081
 Fuck! Shit.

879
01:20:29.964 --> 01:20:31.945
 How are you doing?

880
01:20:31.945 --> 01:20:36.219
 - How are you?
 - It hurts.
 Marichka, we need a boat.

881
01:20:37.263 --> 01:20:40.807
 A boat. The sea, a boat, a rowboat.

882
01:20:42.268 --> 01:20:43.935
 We need a boat.

883
01:20:47.377 --> 01:20:49.775
 A fucking boat! A boat.

884
01:20:50.297 --> 01:20:52.069
 - A rowboat!
 - Yes.

885
01:20:52.591 --> 01:20:53.945
 Hurry.

886
01:20:54.468 --> 01:20:58.116
 - You okay? Come on.
 - Hurry.
 Hurry. Hurry.

887
01:21:52.755 --> 01:21:54.110
 It's okay.

888
01:22:37.592 --> 01:22:40.406
 Look at that, Theo. They love my baby.

889
01:22:43.952 --> 01:22:47.393
 I want to call her Bazouka.
 Bazouka?

890
01:22:47.393 --> 01:22:49.374
 You don't like it?

891
01:22:49.374 --> 01:22:51.667
 I was getting used to Froley.

892
01:22:52.294 --> 01:22:54.274
 Froley's a man's name.

893
01:22:55.214 --> 01:22:59.383
 What is he thinking, giving you
 a boy's name? You're a girl.

894
01:22:59.906 --> 01:23:03.764
 We have a boat. Stay here.
 In one hour, we go.

895
01:23:03.764 --> 01:23:05.014
 Thanks.

896
01:23:05.536 --> 01:23:07.308
 Human Project real?

897
01:23:08.352 --> 01:23:09.811
 It better be.

898
01:24:31.769 --> 01:24:35.418
 Drop your gun! Drop your gun!
 Put your hands up!
 Put your fucking hands in the air!

899
01:24:35.418 --> 01:24:37.816
 Okay, is clear! Is clear!

900
01:24:37.816 --> 01:24:39.902
 Hands above your head
 and fucking move that here.

901
01:24:39.902 --> 01:24:41.257
 You killed my fucking cousin!

902
01:24:41.257 --> 01:24:45.324
 Get on your knees!
 On your knees, you fucking...
 He was 19!

903
01:24:45.324 --> 01:24:46.991
 Don't kill him!

904
01:24:47.618 --> 01:24:49.285
 Don't kill him!

905
01:24:50.329 --> 01:24:51.996
 Watch the flanks!

906
01:24:52.936 --> 01:24:55.437
 Kee. Thank God.

907
01:24:57.106 --> 01:25:00.129
 You'll be safe now. How's the child?

908
01:25:06.699 --> 01:25:10.036
 You put their lives at risk.
 Just let her go.
 You don't know what you're doing.

909
01:25:10.036 --> 01:25:12.851
 No? Look around you.

910
01:25:12.851 --> 01:25:17.231
 It's the Uprising.
 And they haven't even seen the baby.
 Let's go.

911
01:25:17.231 --> 01:25:19.002
 No! Get off...

912
01:25:19.629 --> 01:25:24.113
 Not in front of the girl.
 Wait till we get around the corner.
 Then do them all.

913
01:25:24.113 --> 01:25:25.364
 Come on!

914
01:25:25.364 --> 01:25:27.658
 Oh, lads

915
01:25:27.658 --> 01:25:30.264
 You should have seen us gannin'

916
01:25:30.994 --> 01:25:35.791
 Passing the folks along the road
 And all of them was starin'

917
01:25:35.791 --> 01:25:40.586
 And all the lads and lasses there
 They all had smilin' faces

918
01:26:05.508 --> 01:26:06.654
 Fuck!

919
01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:25.527
 Sorry. Sorry.

920
01:26:44.610 --> 01:26:47.007
 Move it! Get her inside!

921
01:26:48.572 --> 01:26:50.031
 Faron!

922
01:27:00.042 --> 01:27:04.003
 Get her inside!
 Get her in the building now!
 Now! Move it! Now!

923
01:27:28.404 --> 01:27:30.279
 Sarge, left flank!

924
01:27:30.802 --> 01:27:32.991
 Slug the fuckers!

925
01:27:35.807 --> 01:27:38.621
 Don't shoot! Citizens! We citizens!

926
01:28:53.176 --> 01:28:55.260
 Go check the roof!

927
01:30:11.901 --> 01:30:14.715
 I was carrying the baby up the stairs.

928
01:30:15.342 --> 01:30:17.217
 I started crying.

929
01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:23.265
 I'd forgotten what they looked like.
 They're so beautiful.
 They're so tiny.

930
01:30:25.143 --> 01:30:26.916
 Julian was wrong!

931
01:30:26.916 --> 01:30:29.105
 She thought it could be peaceful!

932
01:30:29.105 --> 01:30:33.589
 But how can it be peaceful
 when they try to take away your dignity?

933
01:30:33.589 --> 01:30:35.465
 We need him, Theo!

934
01:30:36.091 --> 01:30:38.489
 We need the baby. We need him!

935
01:30:41.514 --> 01:30:43.285
 It's a girl, Luke.

936
01:30:46.519 --> 01:30:47.664
 A girl?

937
01:30:50.168 --> 01:30:51.731
 I had a sister.

938
01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:56.840
 Theo! Theo!

939
01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:16.235
 You okay?

940
01:31:18.217 --> 01:31:19.571
 How is she?

941
01:31:20.302 --> 01:31:21.657
 Annoyed.

942
01:32:34.230 --> 01:32:36.316
 My God, the baby.

943
01:32:36.316 --> 01:32:39.130
 Move back! Fucking move back!

944
01:32:42.364 --> 01:32:45.909
 Stop! Cease fire! Cease firing!

945
01:32:45.909 --> 01:32:51.330
 - Cease firing!
 - Cease firing!

946
01:33:06.033 --> 01:33:08.952
 We've got two coming through,
 coming out.

947
01:34:06.615 --> 01:34:08.386
 Second floor, left!

948
01:34:10.368 --> 01:34:11.723
 Medic!

949
01:34:25.071 --> 01:34:26.321
 Marichka!

950
01:35:11.263 --> 01:35:13.869
 No, Marichka no go. You go.

951
01:35:13.869 --> 01:35:16.788
 - You go.
 - Marichka, come. Marichka.

952
01:35:17.415 --> 01:35:20.333
 - Marichka, get in the boat!
 - Go, boat!

953
01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:30.925
 The buoy! Theo, the buoy!

954
01:36:40.519 --> 01:36:41.978
 You okay?

955
01:36:41.978 --> 01:36:44.064
 Yeah. You?

956
01:36:44.064 --> 01:36:45.314
 Yeah.

957
01:36:49.694 --> 01:36:51.362
 What a day.

958
01:36:52.718 --> 01:36:56.785
 We're too late, aren't we?
 No. No, we're fine.

959
01:36:56.785 --> 01:37:00.850
 But they said they wouldn't wait.
 Trust me. They'll come back.

960
01:37:15.345 --> 01:37:19.932
 I'm bleeding. Jesus, shit, I'm bleeding!
 - No, no, no, it's me.
 - I'm bleeding everywhere.

961
01:37:21.184 --> 01:37:23.373
 - It's me.
 - What?

962
01:37:24.834 --> 01:37:26.398
 He got me.

963
01:37:26.398 --> 01:37:27.858
 Bad?

964
01:37:27.858 --> 01:37:30.151
 No. I'm fine.

965
01:37:31.507 --> 01:37:33.383
 Keep her close, Kee.

966
01:37:34.531 --> 01:37:37.971
 Whatever happens, whatever they say,

967
01:37:39.327 --> 01:37:41.099
 you keep her close.

968
01:37:44.854 --> 01:37:46.834
 It's going to be okay.

969
01:37:53.925 --> 01:37:56.740
 She's probably got wind. Wind her.

970
01:37:57.992 --> 01:38:00.076
 Put her on your shoulder.

971
01:38:00.703 --> 01:38:03.204
 Just... Just tap her back.

972
01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:13.319
 Gently.

973
01:38:18.846 --> 01:38:20.096
 Gently.

974
01:38:34.383 --> 01:38:35.841
 There you go.

975
01:38:38.970 --> 01:38:40.846
 Oh, Jesus.

976
01:38:43.975 --> 01:38:45.330
 Dylan.

977
01:38:48.772 --> 01:38:52.316
 I'll call my baby Dylan.
 It's a girl's name, too.

978
01:39:14.631 --> 01:39:15.881
 Theo?

979
01:39:19.532 --> 01:39:20.678
 Theo?

980
01:39:27.248 --> 01:39:28.290
 Theo!

981
01:39:43.201 --> 01:39:45.494
 Theo, the boat.

982
01:39:48.206 --> 01:39:49.457
 The boat!

983
01:39:51.647 --> 01:39:53.106
 It's okay.

984
01:39:53.733 --> 01:39:55.400
 We are safe now.

985
01:39:56.444 --> 01:39:57.694
 We're safe.
