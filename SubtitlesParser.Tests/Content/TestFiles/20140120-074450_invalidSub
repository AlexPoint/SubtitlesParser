[230][244]Positions. 
[423][440]'Night, boys. 
[1124][1151]ALARM BLEEPS 
[1274][1290]Sorry, lover. 
[1376][1408]SIRENS BLARE OUT 
[1678][1732]Hello. I'm so terribly sorry.|That card paying device thing,|that's a Lobster card, am I right? 
[1732][1760]Oyster card. Ah, well,|that's the problem, you see. 
[1760][1802]I only use my Oyster when there's|an R in the month. It's April. 
[1803][1816]Go, go, go! 
[1817][1845]Diamonds. Genuine. 
[1864][1880]Drive! 
[1880][1902]Works for me. 
[1956][1976]You're just in time, mate. 
[2083][2120]Hello, I'm the Doctor! Happy Easter! 
[2495][2510]SIRENS BLARE OUT 
[2510][2556]Right, close off the area,|get all these people cleared.|She has got to be here somewhere. 
[2556][2580]Robinson, clear the road.|Get the whole place sealed off! 
[2580][2616]She's on the bus! She's on the...|Come on! Get the car! 
[2616][2643]It's definitely her.|Come on, move it! 
[2644][2670]Jackson, follow that bus! 
[2751][2774]Funny thing is,|I don't often do Easter. 
[2774][2799]I can never find it,|it's always at a different time. 
[2799][2830]Although I remember the original. 
[2830][2852]Between you and me,|what really happened was... 
[2852][2870]Oh, sorry, hold on to that for me. 
[2870][2892]Actually, go on, have it, finish it. 
[2892][2915]It's full of sugar and I'm|determined to keep these teeth. 
[2916][2943]Ah! 
[2944][2982]Oh, we've got excitation! 
[2982][3022]I'm picking up something|very strange. I know the feeling. 
[3055][3110]All units in pursuit, registration|Whisky nine seven four,|Golf Hotel Mike. 
[3110][3133]They're heading for|the Gladwell Road Tunnel. 
[3134][3164]Please stop all traffic.|Seal off the North End. 
[3193][3222]The bus has entered the|south entrance of the tunnel.|Officers in pursuit. 
[3223][3250]'Units now arriving|at the North entrance.' 
[3322][3342]Tango 183 at the far end, sir. 
[3342][3366]I've sealed off the exit.|There's no way out, over. 
[3405][3424]I'm right behind. We've got her! 
[3424][3452]Rhondium particles,|that's what I'm looking for. 
[3453][3470]This thing detects them. 
[3470][3494]The little dish should go|round, that little dish there... 
[3495][3517]Right now, a way out|would come in pretty handy. 
[3517][3536]Can you detect me one of those? 
[3560][3578]Lou. Can you hear them? 
[3578][3594]Hear what, sweetheart? 
[3594][3610]The voices. 
[3610][3625]So many voices. 
[3626][3679]Calling to us. Calling so far. 
[3680][3720]Oh, the little dish is going round!|Fascinating. 
[3752][3770]And round. Whoa... 
[3771][3787]Excuse me. Do you mind? 
[3787][3820]Sorry. That was my little dish.|Can't you turn that thing off? 
[3820][3851]What was your name? Christina. 
[3852][3892]Christina, hold on tight.|Everyone, hold on! 
[3918][3960]The voices!|Oh, the voices, they're screaming! 
[4014][4036]What's going on?! 
[4178][4219]Tango 183. Units in position, sir. 
[4229][4266]Uh, sorry to report, but, er,|no sign of the bus. Over. 
[4267][4290]It's gone. Right in front of me. 
[4290][4306]The bus has just... 
[4306][4327]gone. 
[4328][4345]Over. 
[4695][4715]End of the line. 
[4728][4785]Call it a hunch, but I think|we've gone a little bit|further than Brixton. 
[4978][5022]CHIRRUPING 
[5023][5064]We should get out!|Even if that's the Sahara,|we can't stay on board this thing. 
[5064][5082]I'm not going out there! 
[5082][5104]They're still calling. 
[5105][5134]All around us. 
[5135][5172]The voices are crying. 
[5173][5191]What voices, sweetheart? 
[5192][5208]The Dead... 
[5234][5269]We're surrounded by the Dead. 
[5366][5381]That's impossible. 
[5382][5407]There are three suns. Three of them!
[5407][5430]Like when all those|planets were up in the sky! 
[5430][5455]But it was Earth that|moved back then, wasn't it? 
[5456][5478]Oh, man, we're on another world! 
[5478][5506]It's still intact, though!|Not as bad as it looks. 
[5507][5526]The chassis's still holding together.
[5526][5564]Oh, my boss is gonna murder me!|Can you still drive it? 
[5564][5605]Oh, no, the wheels are stuck. Look at|them, they're never gonna budge. 
[5606][5660]Dennison, listen.|We've sealed off the far end,|nothing is to come through. 
[5660][5692]But I don't understand, sir.|How can a bus just disappear? 
[5692][5712]Ready for every emergency. 
[5797][5812]Me too! 
[5813][5852]And what's your name?|I'm the Doctor. Name, not rank. 
[5853][5875]The Doctor. Surname? The Doctor. 
[5875][5892]You're called 'the Doctor'? 
[5893][5930]Yes, I am. That's not a name,|that's a psychological condition. 
[5931][5962]Funny sort of sand, this.|There's a trace of something else. 
[5985][6021]Ack. Eurgh. Blah, that's not good. 
[6022][6038]Well, it wouldn't be, it's sand. 
[6038][6057]No, it tastes like... 
[6076][6102]Never mind. What is it, what's wrong?
[6102][6125]Hold on a minute, I saw you, mate! 
[6125][6147]You had that thing, that machine. 
[6148][6183]Did you make this happen? Oh,|humans on buses, always blaming me. 
[6183][6219]If you must know, I was tracking|a hole in the fabric of reality. 
[6220][6263]Call it a hobby. But it was a tiny|little hole, no danger to anyone. 
[6264][6303]Suddenly it gets big, and we drive|right through it. But then where 
[6303][6338]is it? There's nothing,|there's just sand! 
[6339][6366]All right. 
[6389][6405]You want proof? 
[6405][6431]We drove through this. 
[6502][6536]What the hell was that? And that's? 
[6536][6553]A door. 
[6553][6605]A door in space.|So what you're saying is,|on the other side of that is home? 
[6605][6647]We can get to London through there?|The bus came through, but we can't. 
[6648][6670]Well, then what are we waiting for? 
[6671][6700]Oh, no, don't. I'm going home, mate!|I said don't! 
[6701][6729]HE SCREAMS 
[6790][6820]He was a skeleton, man!|He was bones, just bones! 
[6820][6838]Dennison, er... 
[6839][6867]I think we're out of our depth here.
[6867][6885]We need experts. 
[6885][6920]Get me UNIT. Emergency Code One! 
[6964][6986]It was the bus. 
[6986][7023]Look at the damage,|that was the bus protecting us. 
[7023][7052]Great big box of metal.|Rather like a Faraday cage? 
[7069][7089]Like in a thunderstorm, yeah? 
[7090][7130]Safest place is inside a car,|cos the metal conducts the|lightning right through. 
[7130][7150]We did it in school. 
[7150][7168]But if we can only travel|back inside the bus... 
[7168][7205]A Faraday cage needs to be closed.|That thing's been ripped wide open. 
[7220][7263]Slightly different dynamics with|a wormhole. There's enough metal|to make it work, I think. I hope. 
[7264][7307]Then we have to drive|five tonnes of bus, which is|currently buried in the sand. 
[7307][7332]And we've got nothing|but our bare hands. Correct? 
[7333][7371]I'd say nine and a half tonners,|but the point still stands, yes. 
[7372][7395]Then we need to apply ourselves|to the problem with discipline! 
[7395][7416]Which starts with|appointing a leader. 
[7416][7437]Yes, at last, thank you, so...|Well, thank goodness you've got me! 
[7437][7455]Everyone do exactly as I say! 
[7456][7487]Inside the bus immediately!|Is it safe in there? 
[7488][7518]I don't think anything's safe any|more, but if it's a choice between 
[7518][7544]baking in there or roasting out|here, I'd say baking is slower. 
[7544][7580]Come on! All of you. Right now! 
[7581][7612]And you. 'The Doctor'. 
[7613][7632]Yes, ma'am. 
[7632][7647]Up! Come on! 
[7680][7706]Point five,|the crucial thing is, do not panic. 
[7706][7756]Quite apart from anything else,|the smell of sweat inside this|thing is reaching atrocious levels. 
[7757][7796]We don't need to add any more.|Point six. Team identification. 
[7796][7830]Names. I'm Christina, this man|is apparently 'the Doctor'. 
[7831][7868]Hello. And you? Nathan. 
[7869][7909]I'm Barclay.|Angela, Angela Whittaker. 
[7909][7932]My name's Louis, everyone|calls me Lou, and this is Carmen. 
[7933][7974]Excellent. Memorise those names.|There might be a test. 
[7974][8009]Point seven, assessment|and application of knowledge. 
[8010][8060]Over to you, the Doctor. I thought|you were in charge. I am. 
[8060][8084]And a good leader|utilises her strength. 
[8084][8101]You seem to be the brainbox. 
[8102][8126]So, start boxing. 
[8126][8166]Right. So, the wormhole. 
[8166][8196]We were in the wrong place at the|wrong time. It was just an accident. 
[8197][8230]No, it wasn't. 
[8231][8264]That thing, the doorway. 
[8264][8302]Someone made it. For a reason.|How do you know? 
[8325][8379]She's got a gift.|Ever since she was a little girl,|she can just... tell things. 
[8380][8420]We do the lottery, twice a week.|You don't look like millionaires. 
[8421][8439]No, but we win ten pounds. 
[8440][8478]Every week,|twice a week, ten pounds. 
[8479][8498]Don't tell me that's not a gift! 
[8499][8524]Tell me, Carmen.|How many fingers am I holding up? 
[8525][8550]Three. 
[8550][8569]Four. 
[8569][8622]Very good! Low level psychic ability,|exacerbated by an alien sun. 
[8622][8657]What can you see, Carmen? Tell me.|What's out there? 
[8669][8690]Something... Something is coming. 
[8721][8776]Riding on the wind. And shining.|What is it? 
[8794][8826]Death. Death is coming. 
[8826][8854]We're going to die.|I knew it, man, I said so. 
[8854][8883]We can't die out here.|No-one's gonna find us.|This isn't exactly helping. 
[8884][8911]You can shut up too,|we're not your soldiers.|That's not doing any good... 
[8912][8932]Will we be bones,|like the bus driver?! 
[8933][8950]Stop whimpering, all of you! 
[8951][8982]All right now.|Stop it, everyone, stop it! 
[8982][8999]Angela, look at me. 
[8999][9040]Angela, Angela, answer me one|question, Angela. That's it, at me, 
[9040][9076]at me. There we go,|Angela, just answer me one thing. 
[9077][9109]When you got on this bus,|where were you going? 
[9109][9136]Doesn't matter now, does it?|Answer the question. 
[9137][9159]Just home. And what's home? 
[9159][9204]Me and Mike.|And Suzanne. That's my daughter. 
[9204][9227]She's 18. Suzanne. Good. 
[9227][9253]What about you? 
[9253][9268]Dunno. 
[9268][9292]Going round Tina's.|Who's Tina? Your girlfriend? 
[9293][9317]Not yet. 
[9317][9335]Good boy. What about you, Nathan? 
[9335][9360]Bit strapped for cash, 
[9360][9382]I lost my job last week. 
[9383][9398]I was gonna stay in. 
[9399][9422]Watch TV. Brilliant, and you two? 
[9422][9439]I was going to cook. 
[9440][9476]It's his turn tonight.|Then I clear up. What's for tea? 
[9493][9520]Chops.|Nice couple of chops and gravy. 
[9521][9548]Nothing special.|Oh, that's special, Lou. 
[9548][9564]That is so special. 
[9564][9589]Chops and gravy.|What about you, Christina? 
[9605][9625]I was going... 
[9626][9649]so far away. Far away. 
[9650][9679]Chops and gravy. Watching TV.|Mike and Suzanne and poor old Tina. 
[9680][9700]Hey! Just think of them. 
[9700][9773]Cos that planet out there,|all three suns and wormholes and|alien sand, that planet is nothing. 
[9774][9805]You hear me? Nothing compared to|all those things waiting for you. 
[9820][9855]Food and home and people, 
[9855][9874]hold on to that. 
[9884][9916]Cos we're gonna get there. I promise.
[9930][9952]I'm gonna get you home. 
[10255][10288]Isolate the area! Yes, ma'am.|Establish an exclusion zone. 
[10288][10307]Any media, move them back. 
[10308][10332]Any trouble, arrest them,|Yes, Ma'am. 
[10332][10359]I want the vehicles in the|standard Procedure Five layout. 
[10360][10405]All outreach officers will report|to me via Sergeant Calhoon,|is that understood? Yes, Ma'am. 
[10405][10438]Captain, I'm Detective Inspector|McMillan. Clear the area, thank you.
[10439][10456]Yes, but I was here when the... 
[10456][10485]thing... the bus, with the...|I've read the report. 
[10486][10522]Now clear the area! Pandovski,|get these men out of the zone. 
[10523][10541]There's somebody on that bus... 
[10542][10564]She's mine! Just move back, sir. 
[10590][10618]Perimeter guard, stand ready. 
[10618][10648]Stay alert. 
[10648][10666]Any hostile activity, 
[10666][10692]shoot to kill. 
[10703][10734]Here we go! That's my boys! 
[10735][10767]We lay a flat surface between|the bus and the wormhole, like|duckboards, and reverse into it! 
[10768][10789]Let some air out of the tyres,|just a little bit. 
[10790][10806]Spreads the weight of the bus,|gives you more grip. 
[10807][10834]Oh, that's good!|Holidays in the Kalahari. 
[10834][10853]Yeah, but those wheels go deep. 
[10854][10873]Then start digging. With what? 
[10873][10902]With this. 
[10958][10982]Got anything else in there? 
[10982][11007]Try that, might help with the seats.
[11007][11025]Thanks! 
[11025][11048]I can't find the keys. 
[11049][11078]Buses don't have keys.|There's a master switch,|one button for start, 
[11078][11118]the other one for stop, yeah?|Right. Hold on, oh, I've got it. 
[11118][11148]Here we go, hold tight, ding ding! 
[11148][11168]ENGINE SPLUTTERS 
[11206][11224]Oh, that doesn't sound too good. 
[11241][11280]Oh! Never mind losing half|the top deck, you know what's worse? 
[11280][11300]Sand. 
[11301][11322]Tiny little grains of sand. 
[11323][11342]The engine's clogged up. 
[11343][11372]Anyone know mechanics? 
[11372][11396]Me!|I did a two-week NVQ at the garage. 
[11396][11411]Never finished it, but... 
[11412][11442]Off you go then, try stripping|the air filter, fast as you can. 
[11442][11464]Back in two ticks. Wait a minute! 
[11464][11504]You're the man with all the answers.|I'm not letting you out of my sight.
[11562][11590]CHIRRUPING 
[11614][11637]Easier if you|left that backpack behind. 
[11637][11682]Where I go, it goes. A backpack with|a spade and an axe. 
[11682][11736]Christina, who's going so far|away, and yet scared by|the sound of a siren. Who are you? 
[11736][11758]You can talk. 
[11759][11784]Let's just say|we're two equal mysteries. 
[11784][11801]We make quite a couple. 
[11801][11850]We don't make any sort of couple,|thank you very much. Come on then. 
[11850][11904]Tell me. If Carmen's right,|if that wormhole's not an accident,|then what is it? 
[11904][11923]Has someone done this on purpose?|I don't know. 
[11924][11962]But every single instinct|of mine is telling me to get|off this planet, right now. 
[11962][11981]And do you think we can? 
[11981][12002]I live in hope. That must be nice. 
[12027][12056]It's Christina de Souza. 
[12057][12083]To be precise,|Lady Christina de Souza. 
[12084][12116]Ooh, that's handy. Cos I'm a Lord.|Seriously? 
[12116][12139]The Lord of where?|It's quite a big estate. 
[12155][12182]No, but there's something|more about you. 
[12182][12204]That device you were carrying. 
[12204][12236]And the wormhole. Like you knew. 
[12236][12267]And the way you stride|around this place, like... 
[12288][12315]Like? Like you're not quite... 
[12336][12356]Anyway! Come on! Allons-y! 
[12356][12385]Oui, mais pas si nous|allons vers un cauchemar. 
[12386][12418]Oh, we were made for each other! 
[12419][12441]Ah. Don't like the look of that. 
[12442][12458]Storm clouds. 
[12458][12487]Must be hundreds of miles away.|Getting closer. 
[12487][12534]If that's a sand storm, we'll get|ripped to shreds. It's a storm. 
[12534][12552]Who says it's sand? 
[12572][12609]Closer... and closer and closer... 
[12610][12645]Where is it?|There, there on the seat. 
[12645][12678]You're hardly going to get|a signal, we're on another planet! 
[12679][12722]Oh, just watch me.|Right, now, bit of hush, thank you. 
[12722][12744]Gotta remember the number,|very important number. 
[12766][12785]'Hello, Pizza Geronimo?' 
[12785][12817]And again! Ah!|seven-six, not six-seven... 
[12851][12882]'This is the Unified Intelligence|Taskforce. 
[12882][12913]'Please select one of|the following four options.' 
[12913][12960]Oh, I hate these things! No, if you|keep your finger pressed on zero,|you get through to a real person. 
[12961][12984]I saw it on Watchdog!|Thank you, Angela! 
[12984][13008]'UNIT helpline, which|department would you like?' 
[13008][13029]Listen, it's the Doctor! It's me! 
[13050][13093]Captain! Urgent call, ma'am, relayed|direct from HQ. Who is it? Him. 
[13093][13131]It's the Doctor. 
[13132][13176]Doctor. This is|Captain Erisa Magambo. 
[13176][13210]Might I say, sir, it's an honour. 
[13210][13226]Did you just salute? 
[13243][13279]No. Erisa, it's about the bus.|HQ said you're at the tunnel, yeah? 
[13279][13298]And where are you? I'm on the bus. 
[13298][13327]But apart from that, not a clue, 
[13328][13364]except it's very pretty|and pretty dangerous. 
[13365][13405]A body came through here. Have you|sustained any more fatalities? 
[13405][13420]No, but I'm stuck. 
[13421][13449]I haven't got the Tardis, and|I need to analyse that wormhole. 
[13450][13494]We have a scientific advisor|on site, Dr Malcolm Taylor. 
[13494][13520]Just the man|you need, he's a genius. 
[13520][13542]'Oh, is he? We'll see about that.' 
[13556][13578]It's the Doctor. 
[13579][13608]No, I'm all right now, thanks.|It was just a bit of a sore throat, 
[13608][13645]although I've got to be honest,|a cup of tea might be nice. 
[13645][13664]It's THE Doctor. 
[13713][13755]Do you mean... the Doctor-Doctor?! 
[13756][13788]I know. We all want|to meet him one day. 
[13788][13826]But we all know what|that day will bring. I can hear|everything you're saying. 
[13883][13910]Hello, Doctor? Oh, my goodness. 
[13910][13948]Yes, I am. Hello, Malcolm! 
[13948][13972]The Doctor! Cor blimey. 
[13973][13999]I can't believe|I'm actually speaking to you! 
[13999][14014]I mean, I've read all the files! 
[14015][14038]Really? What was your favourite,|the giant robot? 
[14038][14066]No, no hold on, let's sort|out that wormhole. 'Scuse me. 
[14066][14101]On speakerphone, please. 
[14102][14123]I don't want anyone keeping secrets.
[14124][14141]Malcolm, something's|not making sense here. 
[14142][14174]I've got a storm and a wormhole,|I can't help thinking|there's a connection. 
[14174][14203]I need a complete full-range analysis|of that wormhole, the whole thing. 
[14204][14236]I've probably got|the wrong idea, but I've|wired up an integrator. 
[14236][14260]I thought it could measure|the energy signature. 
[14261][14280]No, that'll never work. Listen... 
[14280][14322]It's quite extraordinary, though!|I'm measuring an oscillation|of 15 Malcolms per second. 
[14322][14358]Fifteen what? Fifteen Malcolms.|It's my own little term. 
[14358][14412]A wavelength parcel of ten|kilohertz operating in four|dimensions equals one Malcolm. 
[14412][14452]You named a unit of measurement|after yourself? 
[14452][14504]It didn't do Mr Watt|any harm. Furthermore,|100 Malcolms equals a Bernard. 
[14504][14541]And who's that, your dad? Don't|be ridiculous, that's Quatermass. 
[14541][14594]Right. Fine. But before|I die of old age, which in my case 
[14594][14624]would be quite an achievement,|so congratulations on that, is|there anyone else I can talk to? 
[14625][14654]No, no, no, no, but listen! 
[14654][14699]I set the scanner to register|what it can't detect|and inverted the image. 
[14699][14722]You did what? Is that wrong? 
[14723][14755]No, Malcolm, that's brilliant! So you|can actually measure the wormhole?! 
[14755][14791]OK, I admit, that is genius! 
[14792][14826]The Doctor called me a genius.|I know, I heard. Now, run a|capacity scan. I need a full report. 
[14826][14855]Call me back when you've done it. 
[14855][14870]And Malcolm? 
[14871][14889]You're my new best friend. 
[14889][14906]And you're mine too, sir. 
[14907][14938]Barclay, I'm holding on to this.|Then you'd better bring it back! 
[14971][14991]You're mine... He's gone. 
[14992][15014]He's gone. 
[15049][15078]CHIRRUPING 
[15078][15109]Send this back to Earth, see if|Malcolm can analyse the storm. 
[15110][15170]There's something in those clouds,|something shining. Look... 
[15171][15190]Like metal... 
[15191][15221]Why would there be metal in a storm?
[15221][15268]So fast and strong,|they ride the storm. 
[15268][15302]They are the storm. 
[15317][15333]But what are they? 
[15342][15366]They devour. 
[15380][15403]Did you hear something?|Hold on. Busy. 
[15404][15441]There was a noise,|like a sort of... 
[15442][15476]CHIRRUPING 
[15477][15511]Doctor... 
[15512][15532]There's something new. 
[15572][15608]That's wait.|I shout wait, people usually wait. 
[15608][15634]You speak the language?|Every language. 
[15634][15652]THEY CHIRRUP 
[15671][15692]That's begging for mercy. 
[15696][15733]That means 'move.' Ooh!|You're learning. 
[15790][15821]These fly things, they must be|responsible. They brought us here. 
[15821][15844]No, no, no, no, no!|Look at the ship, it's a wreck. 
[15844][15866]They crashed, just like us. 
[15892][15918]But this place is freezing! 
[15918][15937]The hull's made of Photafine steel...
[15960][15979]..turns cold when it's hot. 
[15980][16005]Boiling desert outside,|freezing ship inside. 
[16005][16034]Since I met you, Christina,|we've been through all the extremes! 
[16034][16060]That's how I like things. Extreme. 
[16104][16124]Oh, this is beautiful! 
[16124][16142]Intact, it must have|been magnificent. 
[16142][16165]A proper streamlined deep-spacer! 
[16166][16188]I'll remember that|as I'm being slowly tortured. 
[16189][16225]At least I'm bleeding on the floor|of a really well-designed spaceship!
[16336][16373]Oh, right, good, yes, hello!|That's a telepathic translator. 
[16374][16403]He can understand us. 
[16404][16437]Still sounds like gibberish to me. 
[16438][16461]That's what I said,|he can understand us. 
[16461][16496]Doesn't work the other way round. 
[16497][16534]"You will suffer for your crimes... 
[16550][16569]"etcetera. You have 
[16569][16615]"committed an act of violence|against the Tritovore race." 
[16615][16632]Tritovores,|they're called Tritovores. 
[16632][16683]"You came here in the 200|to destroy us..." 
[16683][16704]Sorry, what's the 200? It's the bus. 
[16704][16726]Number 200, they mean the bus. 
[16726][16755]Oh! No, look, I think you're making|the same mistake Christina did. 
[16756][16790]I'm the Doctor, by the way,|and this is Christina,|the Honourable Lady Christina. 
[16790][16807]At least I hope she's honourable! 
[16807][16822]We got pulled through that wormhole. 
[16823][16839]The 200 doesn't|look like that normally. 
[16839][16856]It's broken, just the same as you. 
[16918][16944]What are they doing?|They believe me. 
[16944][16962]What, as simple as that? 
[16962][16986]I've got a very honest face. 
[16986][17014]And the translator says|I'm telling the truth. 
[17014][17040]Plus, the face. 
[17041][17092]Right! So, first things first,|there's a very strange storm heading|our way, can you send out a probe? 
[17093][17111]HE CHIRRUPS 
[17111][17139]Ah, they've lost power. 
[17159][17191]Hmm, the crash knocked the mainline|crystallography out of synch. 
[17192][17223]But if I can jiggle it back... 
[17252][17279]I thank you! 
[17280][17311]Yes, I am! Frequently. 
[17312][17338]Okey-doke, let's launch that probe. 
[17405][17420]The Scorpion Nebula. 
[17420][17438]We're on the other side|of the universe. 
[17438][17464]Just what you wanted, so far away. 
[17495][17520]The planet of San Helios. 
[17520][17537]And that's us? 
[17537][17555]We're on another world. 
[17556][17590]We have been for quite a while.|I know, but seeing it like that... 
[17590][17621]It's good, isn't it? Wonderful. 
[17621][17644]THEY CHIRRUP 
[17644][17679]The Tritovores were going|to trade with San Helios. 
[17679][17707]Population of one hundred billion. 
[17708][17734]Plenty of waste matter|for them to absorb. 
[17734][17779]By waste matter, you mean? They|feed off what others leave behind. 
[17779][17796]From their... 
[17796][17822]behind. If you see what I mean.|It's perfectly natural. 
[17822][17856]They are flies. Charming.|Just remind me never to kiss them. 
[17876][17897]THEY CHIRRUP 
[17897][17916]San Helios City. 
[17916][17937]That's amazing. 
[17937][17994]But you've seen this sort|of thing before, haven't you?|Thousands of times. 
[17994][18033]That Lordship of yours...|The Lord of where, exactly? 
[18034][18055]Of Time. 
[18056][18079]I come from a race of people|called Time Lords. 
[18080][18101]You're an alien? Yeah. 
[18101][18123]But you don't have to kiss me either.
[18124][18153]You look human. You look Time Lord. 
[18184][18234]Anyway! So if that's San Helios,|all we need to do is find that city.|They can help us! 
[18234][18270]I don't think it's that simple. 
[18320][18367]We're in the city right now.|But it's sand! 
[18368][18404]That first image, the temples|and things, what's that, then? 
[18404][18425]Ancient history?|HE CHIRRUPS 
[18445][18485]The image was taken last year.|It became a desert in one year? 
[18502][18521]I said there was something|in the sand. 
[18556][18605]The city, the oceans, the mountains, 
[18606][18622]the wildlife. 
[18623][18640]And 100 billion people. 
[18640][18661]Turned to sand. 
[18662][18682]All those voices in Carmen's head. 
[18697][18720]She's hearing them die. 
[18721][18743]But I've got sand in my hair. 
[18743][18778]That's dead people!|Oh, that's disgusting! Oh! 
[18778][18801]Something destroyed|the whole of San Helois. 
[18802][18829]Yes, but in my hair!|MOBILE RINGS 
[18847][18871]'Malcolm! Tell me the bad news!' 
[18872][18887]Oh, you are clever! 
[18887][18904]It is bad news! 
[18905][18935]It's the wormhole, Doctor,|it's getting bigger! 
[18936][18988]We've gone way past 100 Bernards,|I haven't invented a name for that. 
[18989][19013]'How can it get bigger by itself?' 
[19013][19032]Well, that's why I'm phoning! 
[19033][19054]You'll work it out,|if I know you, sir. 
[19055][19083]Doctor, we estimate|the circumference of 
[19083][19133]your invisible wormhole is now|four miles, heading upwards. 
[19133][19153]I've grounded|all flights above London. 
[19154][19183]We can't risk anyone else falling|through. Good work, both of you. 
[19183][19200]But I have to know. 
[19200][19235]Does that wormhole constitute|a danger to this planet? 
[19236][19252]Oh, sorry, call waiting, gotta go. 
[19252][19281]Call waiting?!|He's a devil, that one! 
[19290][19325]Yep? Doctor, it's Nathan. 
[19325][19360]We got those duckboard things down,|but... It's my fault. 
[19360][19379]No, it's not, don't say that.|What's happened? 
[19379][19417]We kept on|turning the engine, but... 
[19418][19454]We're out of petrol. Used it all up.
[19455][19509]Even if we can get|those wheels out...|This bus is never going to move. 
[19524][19557]What is it, what's wrong?|Doctor, tell me. 
[19558][19583]'You promised you'd get us home.' 
[19583][19611]Doctor? Are you still there? 
[19611][19635]Doctor, tell me, what did he say? 
[19635][19681]CHIRRUPING 
[19682][19699]It's the probe.|It's reached the storm. 
[19716][19753]And what's he saying?|It's not a storm. 
[19829][19845]It's a swarm. 
[19855][19878]Millions of them... 
[19878][19893]Billions. 
[19980][20006]Ah! We've lost the probe.|I think it got eaten. 
[20006][20034]Everything on this planet gets eaten.|How far away is that swarm? 
[20034][20057]Hundred miles. But at that speed,|it'll be here in twenty minutes. 
[20058][20100]THE ALIEN CHIRRUPS|No, they're not just coming for us. 
[20100][20122]They want the wormhole.|They're heading for Earth! 
[20122][20145]Show the analysis. 
[20166][20225]Incredible! They swarm out|of a wormhole, strip the planet|bare, then move on to the next world.
[20226][20258]Start the life cycle all over again.|So... 
[20258][20276]they make the wormholes?|They must do. 
[20276][20310]But how? They don't exactly|look like technicians. 
[20311][20337]And if the wormhole belongs to|them, why are they 100 miles away? 
[20337][20363]Because they need to be? 
[20363][20395]No. That's bonkers. Hang on! 
[20412][20428]Yes! 
[20428][20468]Oh! Do you see? Billions of them,|flying in formation,|all around the planet. 
[20468][20524]Round and round and round,|faster and faster and faster, till|they generate a rupture in space! 
[20524][20552]The speed of them,|and the numbers, and the size... 
[20552][20576]all of that rips|the wormhole into existence. 
[20576][20595]And the wormhole's getting bigger?|Because they're getting closer! 
[20596][20623]But how do they get through?|Cos that wormhole's|a killer, we've seen it! 
[20623][20645]No, no, see the exo-skeleton? 
[20646][20661]Metal. 
[20661][20684]They've got bones of metal! 
[20684][20714]They eat metal, and extrude it|into the exo-skeleton! 
[20715][20767]So their velocity makes the wormhole,|then their body makes it safe! 
[20768][20785]Perfect design! 
[20786][20820]Those things are going to turn|the entire Earth into a desert. 
[20820][20847]So why exactly are you smiling? 
[20864][20896]Worse it gets, the more I love it!|Me too. 
[20966][20986]RUMBLE 
[20986][21034]Sounds like a storm. If it rains,|we've got water. 
[21034][21064]No water. All of it, dust. 
[21086][21130]But the girl...|Don't now, sweetheart. What girl? 
[21130][21165]The girl... She will fly... 
[21165][21196]The thing is,|Doctor, you're missing the obvious. 
[21196][21216]We came here through|the wormhole, yes? 
[21216][21240]But our Tritovore friends didn't. 
[21241][21265]They came here|to trade with San Helios. 
[21266][21296]Therefore, the question is,|why did they crash? 
[21296][21333]Ah, good question! 
[21334][21361]What a team!|Like she said, why did you crash? 
[21361][21377]Oh, yes. 
[21378][21423]Gravity Well, look. Goes all the way|down to the engine. So what happened?
[21424][21444]THE ALIEN CHIRRUPS 
[21444][21481]He says the drive system stalled. 
[21481][21510]Ten miles up, they fell out of|the sky. But what caused that? 
[21510][21550]Which means, no idea. Yeah. 
[21550][21578]But wait a minute, that's|a crystal nucleus down there, yes? 
[21578][21600]And it looks like|it survived the crash. 
[21600][21621]If the crystal's intact... 
[21622][21661]Oh, yes, that's better than diesel! 
[21661][21690]What, you can use the crystal|to move the bus? I think so. 
[21690][21715]The spaceship's a write-off,|but the 200's small enough. 
[21715][21731]How does a Crystal drive a bus? 
[21732][21766]In a super-clever|outer-spacey way, just trust me! 
[21766][21792]There's the crystal! It's fallen|to the bottom of the well. 
[21792][21819]Have you got access shafts? 
[21820][21850]THE ALIEN CHIRRUPS|All frozen? Maybe I can open them! 
[21851][21867]Internal comms, put that on. 
[21868][21907]You stay here, keep an eye on the|shaft. Tell me if anything happens. 
[22006][22061]If I can use that sunlight to start|the automatic maintenance. Christina?
[22061][22091]If you see a panel opening|in that shaft, let me know. 
[22091][22118]Nothing yet. Anything now? 
[22119][22148]'Fraid not. Any sign of movement? 
[22148][22166]Nope. 
[22167][22182]How's that? 
[22183][22210]Nothing. Any result? 
[22210][22230]Not a dickie bird. 
[22243][22267]So let me get this right. 
[22275][22294]You need that crystal? 
[22313][22340]Then consider it done.|Why, what d'you mean? 
[22351][22362]Christina? 
[22371][22391]Christina! 
[22403][22426]The aristocracy|survives for a reason. 
[22455][22475]We're ready for anything. 
[22504][22520]No! 
[22594][22612]Come on! Come on, come on, come on! 
[22625][22641]That's better. 
[22641][22664]I decide when I stop, thank you. 
[22664][22696]You're about to hit|the security grid. Look! 
[22696][22716]Excellent. 
[22717][22744]So what do I do?|Try the big red button. 
[22767][22786]Well done! 
[22786][22832]Now come back up! I can do that.|Oh, don't you wish? Slowly! 
[22848][22869]Yes, sir. 
[22879][22906]Quite the mystery, aren't you? 
[22907][22938]Lady Christina de Souza. 
[22939][22958]Carrying a winch in her bag. 
[22958][22985]No stranger than you, spaceman. 
[22986][23013]I had this friend, once. 
[23014][23029]She called me spaceman. 
[23029][23066]And was she right? Do you zoom|about the place in a rocket? 
[23066][23090]Well, a little blue box. 
[23106][23123]Travels in more than space. 
[23140][23169]It can journey|through time, Christina. 
[23170][23193]Oh, the places I've been. 
[23194][23212]World War One. 
[23212][23272]Creation of the universe,|end of the universe,|the war between China and Japan. 
[23272][23291]And... 
[23292][23333]the Court of King Athelstan,|in 924 AD. 
[23333][23359]But I don't remember you being there.
[23360][23384]So what are you doing with this? 
[23384][23399]Excuse me. 
[23399][23425]A gentleman never goes|through a lady's possessions. 
[23425][23468]CHIRRUPING|It's the Cup of Athelstan. 
[23469][23505]Given to the first King of Britain,|as a coronation gift from Hywel,|King of the Welsh. 
[23506][23548]But it's been held in the|International Gallery for 200 years, 
[23548][23587]which makes you,|Lady Christina, a thief. 
[23587][23622]I like to think I liberated it.|Don't tell me you need the money. 
[23623][23658]Daddy lost everything. Invested|his fortune in the Icelandic banks. 
[23658][23694]No, no, no, if you're short|of cash, you rob a bank. 
[23694][23724]Stealing this, that's a lifestyle. 
[23725][23742]I take it you disapprove? 
[23742][23759]Absolutely. 
[23759][23786]Except... 
[23786][23810]That little blue box. 
[23810][23829]I stole it. 
[23830][23854]From my own people. 
[23854][23890]Good boy. You were right.|We're quite a team. 
[23903][23924]SHRIEKING 
[23924][23955]What the blazes was that? We never|did find out why the ship crashed. 
[23956][23979]Christina, I think you|should come back up. Too late. 
[23980][24013]I can see it. Careful. Slowly.|Have you got an open-vent system? 
[24014][24038]CHIRRUPING|I thought so.|What does that mean? 
[24038][24064]It's like when birds fly into|the engines of an aircraft. 
[24064][24092]GROWLING AND PANTING 
[24092][24129]One of the creatures.|Got trapped in the vents.|Caused the crash. Christina, get out.
[24129][24178]It's not moving, I think it's|injured. No, it's dormant, because|it's so cold down there. 
[24178][24215]But your body heat is raising the|temperature. I tend to have that|effect. 
[24215][24230]Almost there. 
[24230][24258]Not just the crystal. I need|the whole bed, the plate thing. 
[24258][24284]SHE GRUNTS 
[24329][24348]I've got it! Come on, come on! 
[24403][24418]Come on, come on, come on, come on! 
[24467][24480]It's gonna eat its way up! 
[24507][24530]THE CREATURE SHRIEKS 
[24531][24554]Oh, she's good! 
[24574][24606]That's it, that's it.|I've got you, I've got you! 
[24606][24635]CHIRRUPING|Isn't she just? 
[24689][24730]Commander! Mission complete!|Now we've got to get back|to the 200, all of us. 
[24730][24747]CHIRRUPING|Oh, don't be so daft! 
[24748][24777]A captain can leave his ship,|if there's a bus standing by. 
[24777][24830]LOUD GROANING|What the hell was that?|Is this place safe? 
[24831][24858]It's the creature. It's not dead. 
[24858][24894]CHIRRUPING|Maybe you didn't hit|just one of them. 
[24894][24920]If you hit a swarm...|Do you mean there's more on board? 
[24920][24942]This ship's built|inside a metal sleeve. 
[24942][24980]They can move through the|infrastructure, all around us.|LOUD THUD 
[24980][25006]And they wake up hungry. You've got|to come with us now! 
[25006][25051]You can come back to Earth, we'll|find you a home! And that's the word|of a lady! Come on! 
[25059][25084]CRASHING 
[25147][25166]HE SHRIEKS|No, don't! 
[25216][25233]There's nothing we can do. Run! 
[25381][25398]What sort of storm is that? 
[25470][25520]Run! Run, run, run, run, run! 
[25520][25567]MOBILE RINGS 
[25568][25580]Doctor... 
[25580][25612]Not now, Malcolm! 
[25612][25634]Fair do's. 
[25634][25650]He's a busy man. 
[25772][25789]At last! Where've you been?! 
[25789][25810]Get inside, get them sitting down. 
[25810][25828]Now then, let's have a look. 
[25828][25856]So what does that crystal do?|Oh, nothing, don't need the crystal. 
[25856][25897]I risked my life for that!|No no, you risked your life|for these. The clamps! 
[25915][25925]One there. 
[25944][25958]One there. 
[25985][26015]One there. And one there!|But what are the clamps for? 
[26015][26053]Do they turn the wheels? Something|like that. I just need to fix this. 
[26053][26071]Have you got a hammer in that bag? 
[26071][26090]Funnily enough. 
[26090][26107]Phone, phone... Press redial. 
[26135][26174]Malcolm, it's me! I'm ready! Ready|for what? I don't know! You tell me! 
[26175][26227]I'll try to get back. There might be|something following us. You need to|close the wormhole. 
[26227][26277]Would that be a compressed burst of|feedback on a counter-oscillation,|perchance? 
[26277][26322]Oh, Malcolm! You're brilliant!|Coming from you, sir,|that means the world. 
[26323][26354]Doctor, what sort of something?|That wormhole is now 
[26354][26392]measuring ten miles and growing.|I need to know the exact nature 
[26392][26410]of the threat. Sorry, gotta go. 
[26411][26456]All troops, mobilise and stand|ready. Possible Code Red. Unknown! 
[26456][26492]Understood. Code Red!|Repeat, Code Red unknown! 
[26646][26676]Ah, it's not compatible! Bus,|spaceship, spaceship, bus. 
[26677][26698]I need to weld|the two systems together. 
[26698][26720]And how do you do that?|I need something 
[26720][26766]non-corrosive, something malleable,|something ductile, something... 
[26766][26782]Gold. 
[26783][26802]Oh, no you don't. 
[26803][26819]Christina, what is it worth now? 
[26819][26845]Hey, hey, use this! I said gold. 
[26845][26884]It is gold.|Oh, they saw you coming. Christina! 
[27043][27075]It's over 1,000 years old,|worth £18 million. 
[27076][27096]Promise me you'll be careful. 
[27096][27113]I promise. 
[27194][27216]I hate you. 
[27245][27295]Done it! Transmit that,|and the wormhole should close. 
[27296][27338]Then do it. Well, after the Doctor's|come through, obviously. 
[27338][27367]I'm sorry. Believe me. 
[27368][27398]That wormhole constitutes|a major threat, 
[27398][27442]and I have a duty to every man,|woman and child on this planet. 
[27443][27476]It's got to be closed immediately. 
[27477][27514]That's an order. No, no, no. 
[27514][27540]No, we can't just abandon him!|He's the Doctor! 
[27541][27561]How many times has|he saved our lives? 
[27561][27601]I won't let you, ma'am.|I simply won't! 
[27655][27682]Right now, soldier. 
[27683][27718]This is your driver speaking! Hold on|tight! What for? What's he doing? 
[27719][27754]Do as he says! What are you doing?|ENGINE STARTS 
[27754][27789]Come on, that's it...|You can do it, you beauty! 
[27790][27809]One last trip!

[27999][28018]Ah, you are so kidding me! 
[28061][28089]We're flying! It's flying! 
[28111][28130]He's flying the bus! 
[28152][28175]It's a miracle! 
[28176][28214]Anti-gravity clamps.|Didn't I say? Round we go. 
[28305][28327]Doctor! They're coming! 
[28385][28422]I will never surrender. Never. 
[28440][28462]Do you think this thing will|survive the journey back? 
[28463][28482]Only one way to find out! 
[28483][28509]Next stop... Planet Earth!

[31113][31154]Welcome back. If you could step away|from the bus to be safe. 
[31154][31185]As fast as you can. It's standard|procedure. We need to screen you, 
[31185][31212]and then you'll all be taken to|debriefing. I don't count. 
[31212][31236]No, but Doctor...|With me, thank you. 
[31266][31298]Doctor! You must be Malcolm! 
[31298][31332]Oh! Oh, I love you. 
[31333][31393]I love you, I love you. 
[31406][31424]To your station, Doctor Taylor. 
[31438][31462]Yes, ma'am. 
[31496][31519]I love you! 
[31587][31632]Doctor, I salute you,|whether you like it or not. 
[31632][31678]Now, I take it we're safe from|those things? They'll start again. 
[31678][31718]Generate a new doorway. It's not|their fault, it's|their natural life cycle. 
[31718][31760]But I'll see if I can nudge the|wormholes on to uninhabited planets. 
[31761][31794]Closer to home, Captain,|those two lads... 
[31794][31821]Very good in a crisis. 
[31822][31858]Nathan needs a job,|Barclay's good with engines.|You could do a lot worse. 
[31859][31889]Privates Nathan and Barclay,|UNIT's finest. 
[31913][31930]I'll see what I can do. 
[31930][31997]And I've got something for you.|Better than a bus, any day! 
[31998][32019]Hello! 
[32019][32042]Found in the gardens|of Buckingham Palace. 
[32042][32065]Oh, she doesn't mind. 
[32065][32094]Now, I've got three dead|alien stingrays to clear up. 
[32094][32130]I don't suppose you fancy helping|with the paperwork? Not a chance! 
[32131][32146]Till we meet again, Doctor. 
[32147][32164]I hope so. 
[32180][32244]I said I'm back, Suzanne, I'm home!|They didn't even know I was gone! 
[32245][32272]HIGH FREQUENCY BEEPING|That's quite enough of that! 
[32294][32312]She is not getting away this time. 
[32330][32371]Little blue box! Just like you said!|Right then, off we go! 
[32372][32402]Come on, Doctor, show me the stars! 
[32403][32428]No. What? 
[32428][32444]I said no. 
[32445][32462]But I saved your life. 
[32462][32475]And you saved mine. 
[32476][32512]So? We're surrounded by police.|I'll go to prison. 
[32512][32550]Yeah. But you were right,|it's not about the money. 
[32551][32598]I only steal things for the|adventure, and today, with you... 
[32599][32642]I want more days like this.|I want every day to be like this. 
[32642][32671]We're made for each other,|you said so yourself. 
[32671][32684]The perfect team. 
[32724][32748]Why not? 
[32764][32825]People have travelled with me and|I've lost them. Lost them all. 
[32825][32840]Never again. 
[32862][32900]Lady Christina de Souza. Oh, I have|waited a long time to say this. 
[32900][32927]I am arresting you|on suspicion of theft. 
[32928][32975]You do not have to say anything,|etcetera, etcetera. 
[32976][32991]Dennison, take her away. 
[33060][33098]Doctor? You take care, now. 
[33098][33118]You too! Chops and gravy, lovely! 
[33118][33143]No, but you be careful. 
[33144][33192]Because your song is ending, sir. 
[33192][33210]What do you mean? 
[33210][33228]It is returning. 
[33228][33256]It is returning through the dark. 
[33257][33286]And then, Doctor... 
[33287][33299]Oh, but then... 
[33319][33354]He will knock four times.

[34000][34034]I'm charging you too!|Aiding and abetting! 
[34034][34074]Yes, I'll just step inside this|police box and arrest myself. 
[34098][34121]Out, now! 
[34284][34311]No! Come back!|THEY LAUGH
