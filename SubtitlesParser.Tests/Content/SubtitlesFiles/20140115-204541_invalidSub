What's here?

326
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,000
A book about the family

327
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,200

And the school also

331
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,800

I do not know, I did not see this before

393
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,800
I think that the man is connected to this school

394
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,900
I do not know

395
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,400

I do not understand this

407
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,400
I said

408
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,900
I said we did not know each other

409
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,200
But all of us in this school
And this image together

410
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,300
Give me a picture

411
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,700

Why did you lie to? -
But he did not lie -

413

Stop lying -
I did not lie -

415
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:50,000
I did not want that the Chair continue with your life
These memories

416
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,500
I did not want to remember
I wanted you to oblivion

417
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,300
Say what?

418
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,800
What happened to this school?

419
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,000
There was a man

420
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,500
Primary school

421
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,600
(Name (Fred McGregor

422
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,300
It was Alhaddaiki

423
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,400
I have lived in the basement of the school

424
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,100
You and you children as his life

425
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,700
We did not want the ratification of this first

426
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,000
Ready or not?

427
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,500
You have all innocent

428
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,900
(And you (Nancy

429
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,200
What Tersminh?

430
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,900
This is very beautiful

431
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,100
And you'll be a favorite for him

432
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:05,900
...........

433
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,500
Then we began to notice several things

434
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,700
Yes, it is strange recently

435
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:22,500
We have taken the secret to the cave

436
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,600
There is nothing wrong

437
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,200
Why did not you contact the police then?

438
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:33,000
He has left the city before we can
Be confronted

439
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,000
He has gone, can not anymore Ovetk

440
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,300
If your dreams that, Sandra

441
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,600
Are just memories

442
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,600
Of a very difficult time

443
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,300
I wish you to be right

444
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,600
We must find the rest of the children of the picture

445
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,700

446
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,300
Can not be the full story
Probably no more

447
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:04,800
I have heard what she said "Your mother, it's just
Bad memories

448
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,700
I do not care, you may be mistaken -
It does not matter is the memory only -

449
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,900
How do you know this?

450
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,700
Memories do not kill you

451
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,700
Come, enter the car

452
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,100

We must do something -
Stop -

"Nightmares again, a man burnt face"

492
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,000
I have another nightmare last night I heard

493
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:42,000
Burnt face man trying to kill me

494
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,700
I realized this time that the incident
Got middle school

495
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:49,000
I woke up before finding out anything
But mostly this means something

496
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,700
He does Btaatbai to school this time

497
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,200
And had fled to the basement

498
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,300
What apparently is willing to go
To that place

499
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,200
If he wants me to find something

500
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,200
I started the dream and my eyes wide open

501
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,100
I can not tell you if it is real

502
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,000
I did not sleep during the last 3 days

503
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,200
The grown the dream

504
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,600
If you make this dream mean that I was going to die

505
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,400
Is there any one place with him the same thing?

506
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,100
Can anyone help me?

507
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:29,200
Hope

01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:52,900
He died for all

Did not say anything

517
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,600
Why not go to police

518
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:20,800

Oh my God

524
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,000
You have killed an innocent man

525
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,500
There are no night to pass on
Without that I think about it

527
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,200

What about the elementary school?
Wish (Freddie) that we find something
