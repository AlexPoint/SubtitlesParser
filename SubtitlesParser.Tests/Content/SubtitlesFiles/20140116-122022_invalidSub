{924}{1020}I'm looking at your advertisement|for the airline promotioning giveaway.
{1021}{1059}Ah, the promotion ...
{1059}{1131}Yeah, it's hard to understand|because it's says in addition to ...
{1149}{1209}... but I can't exactly understand|in addition to what ...
{1211}{1271}... because there's actually nothing to add to.

{1408}{1463}10 purchases of any of your|Healthy Choice products ...
{1469}{1534}... equals 500 miles, and with the coupon ...
{1535}{1616}... the same purchases would value 1000 miles?|That's it!
{1625}{1709}Well, do you realize that the monetary|value of this promotion and the price ...
{1715}{1780}... it is potentially worth more than the purchases?
{1830}{1854}... I don't know.
{1992}{2030}Could I call you back?

{21429}{21496}She'd be looking at me!
{21500}{21564}So? What's wrong with looking at you?|It's a free country!
{21568}{21688}It feels like I would be a little tense|and I don't think I'll act like myself.
{21692}{21740}Well ... that's kind of your fault!
{21858}{21930}It's a slight chance|I'm not even coming tonight!
{21951}{21999}Oh! Really?
{22006}{22078}Everyone said you were coming!|Didn't you tell everyone you were coming?

{54999}{55100}It's a lot of family, must be nice.|Do you have brothers and sisters? No.

{56199}{56288}Well, if you gonna go ...|I'm probably not gonna go thou ...
{56292}{56412}Oh, that's too bad 'cause it's so great over there and|if you were there we could say hello to each other.
{56435}{56512}Yes, that would be great, but I'm not exactly|sure, I have so much going on here,
{56515}{56598}... a lot depends on this thing, if it happens|I won't be able to go, but if doesn't happen

{58761}{58809}There you go.|Thanks.
{58877}{58948}I didn't ask for a shrink,|that must have been somebody else.
{58950}{58998}Also that pudding isn't mine.
{59001}{59085}Also I'm wearing a suit today because|I had a very important meeting this morning
{59086}{59158}and I don't have a crying problem.|OK.
{59349}{59397}OK. Hi.|Hi!

{60877}{60925}They'll go.|Great.
{60948}{60995}That's all I'm paying to you guys.|That's cool!
{61015}{61051}When can you leave?|As soon as you want to.
{61053}{61106}Well, I want you to go right away!|I think that's best!
{61106}{61190}And I also really need you to check|out a car for me down there.

{61269}{61339}All the expenses are on your own.|But Leticia said you're gonna cover'em.
{61342}{61392}She didn't know what she said.|Whatever man, that's not cool.
{61393}{61503}David don't just ... seriously ...|right, doesn't make any sense.
{61517}{61579}It's business, seriously.|Look, 100 USD, 2 days work
{61580}{61635}... it's a lot more than your families|are making sitting on their houses.
{61652}{61789}All right? I'm serious now. OK?|Keys to the truck.
{61798}{61824}And you got the gas set up.
{61838}{61872}All right, save receipts on that.
{61888}{62008}Here's the address!|There was his business address too but ...
{62021}{62141}You know ... hit him at his house first.
{62247}{62295}Just fix it Sir!
{62312}{62403}You know, I wanna tell you|something, I've got to tell you ...
{62410}{62434}Oh no!
{62439}{62523}I saw a picture of you guys,|your sisters and you and ...
{62552}{62626}I saw your picture and|I really wanted to meet you.
{62713}{62809}I came to drop my car off|on purpose to try to meet you.
{62905}{62944}Boy ... are you lying?|No.
{62993}{63151}I thought I should tell you ... I don't|want to hide something from you|before we're getting out.
{63200}{63320}Very nice of you to say.|Terrific!
{63357}{63447}I was listening to this morning DJ's this|morning and they always have couples ...
{63447}{63597}... that come in and talk about their|problems ... and this DJ Justice ...
{63597}{63723}... this morning DJ that I really like|... and they were talking about pictures ...
{63723}{63847}... and they're talking about year-book|pictures and how nobody's happy with|the way they look in their pictures ...
{63847}{63969}and ... I just love this guy because he tells|it the way it is  ... he's not a phony ...
{63970}{64090}and this guys ... and this guy calls up and|he's talking about his senior quote ...
{64090}{64172}and so DJ Justice says: "What was your|senior quote?, What was so great about it?"
{64175}{64314}He says "I stole an ancient proverb"|and so he says ok and he says ...
{64317}{64398}... "Confusion say!"|And then DJ Justice says
{64398}{64521}"Confusion or Confucius?"|And it was just so comical.
{64549}{64668}You know, that's my favorite part of the|show and I laugh, I laugh and laugh ...
{64732}{64852}How's your business going?|Did you sell all that pudding?
{64893}{65017}The pudding is not a sales item ...|Why?
{65091}{65233}It's ... not for sale.|Really? Why is that?
{65302}{65440}I'd rather not say, if that's OK.|Oh, I'm sorry, was it like a secret pudding?

{65485}{65605}Let's just keep it between you and I,|if that's possible? Sure, sure.
{65718}{65838}Healthy Choice and American Airlines|got together for this promotion ...
{65841}{65985}If you buy any 10 of Healthy Choice products|they'll reward you 500 frequent flyer miles ...
{65985}{66086}... with a special coupon|they'll up it to a 1000 miles.
{66087}{66202}So I think they're trying to push their|Teriyaki Chicken which is 1.79 USD ...
{66202}{66359}But I went to the Supermarket, I looked arround|and I saw that they had pudding at 0.25 USD/cup.
{66363}{66476}Comes in packages of four, |but insanely ...
{66477}{66581}... the barcodes are on the individual cups!
{66585}{66710}So, a quarter of a cup ...|say you bought 2.50 USD worth ...
{66710}{66826}That's worth 500 miles, ...|with the coupon it's a 1000 miles ...
{66826}{66924}It's a marketing mistake but|I'm taking advantage of it.
{66927}{67047}If you already spent 3000 USD ... that will|get you a million frequent flyer miles ...
{67047}{67122}... you would never have to pay|for a ticket for the rest of your life!
{67129}{67230}So you put a lot pudding so you|can get free coupons. Yes.
{67230}{67278}That's insane!
{67297}{67446}I'm guessing it was a mistake ... but I'm|taking advantage of the wallets offered.
{67474}{67560}Who knows how long it will last!|Too many peoples start doing it!
{67624}{67697}Your sister has told me a history about you.
{67768}{68032}When you were kids you throw|a hammer through the door, right?
{68076}{68144}Threw a hammer!|I don't remember doing that.
{68207}{68255}My sister's a liar!
{68305}{68353}I have to go to the bathroom.
{68934}{68990}Hello! Hi!|Can I talk to you sir?

{69790}{69839}I know.|I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
{69842}{69941}Yeah, but I didn't do anything.|Sir, I've got no way to prove that|you smashed up the bathroom.
{69941}{70030}I didn't do that. I didn't.|Look, I'm gonna have to ask you to go.
{70033}{70089}Ok. I didn't do that.|I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
{70089}{70166}Please don't do this to me!|Sir, I'm gonna call the police!
{70167}{70340}All right. Can I just ...|Sir, I'm gonna crack your fuckin' head open!|Get out of here!
{70368}{70440}We should go right now.|Ok.
{70595}{70642}Thank you.
{72214}{72406}So, you know that ... the harmonium that|you send it up in your office ...
{72534}{72630}Harmonium ...|Piano.
{72731}{72818}Did you steal that from the street?
{72841}{72877}What's this?

{73061}{73148}Yeah, I did, why, is it yours?|No, it's yours.

{73454}{73550}I wouldn't put on any concerts yet!
{73589}{73713}So, I'm sorry, I don't mean to ............ about|the pudding and the harmonium and everything
{73714}{73748}... but ....|Not at all!
{73748}{73896}... you must travel quite a lot!|Oh, no, no no ... I don't travel!

{122166}{122277}Hi Lena. I'm so sorry.
{122277}{122397}I'm so sorry I left you at the hospital.
{122402}{122454}I called a phone sex line ...
{122477}{122570}I called a phone sex line|before I met you.
{122570}{122736}And four blond brothers came after me.|And they hurt you and I'm sorry.
{122752}{122882}And then I had to live again because|I wanted to make sure you never got hurt again.
{122882}{123002}And ... and I have a lot of pudding ...
{123003}{123104}... and 6 to 8 weeks it can be redeemed.
{123106}{123195}So ... if you could just give me|that much time ...
{123195}{123341}... I think I can get enough mileage|to go with you wherever you have to go,|if you have to travel ...
{123341}{123461}... for your work because I don't ever|want to be anywhere without you.
{123461}{123576}So ... could you just let me|redeem the mileage?
{123576}{123686}You left me in the hospital.|I'm sorry.
{123686}{123746}You can't do that.|Ok.
{123746}{123866}If you just give me 6 to 8 weeks,|I can redeem the mileage, ...
{123866}{124064}... and I can go with you|wherever you have to travel.
{125431}{125558}So here we go!
