00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074
RISE OF THE GUARDIANS
2012

2
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,621
Darkness.

3
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,999
That's the first thing I remember.

4
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,671
It was dark, and it was cold.

5
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,173
And I was scared.

6
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:54,887
But then,

7
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,348
then I saw the moon.

8
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:01,728
It was so big and it was so bright.

9
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,480
It seemed to chase the darkness away.

10
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,486
And when it did,

11
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,781
I wasn't scared anymore.

12
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,792
Why I was there
and what I was meant to do,

13
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,628
that I've never known.

14
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,091
And a part of me wonders if I ever will.

15
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,059
Hello. Hello.

16
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,812
Good evening, ma'am. Ma'am?

17
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,773
Excuse me.
Can you tell me where I am?

18
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:19,323
Hello?

19
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,660
My name is Jack Frost.

20
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,162
How do I know that?

21
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,832
The moon told me so.

22
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,294
But that was all he ever told me.

23
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,173
And that was a long, long time ago.

24
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:05,328
Still waiting for cookies!

25
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,967
Yes!

26
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,386
Finally!

27
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,658
How many times
have I told you to knock?

28
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,743
What?

29
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:46,953
The Globe?

30
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,207
Shoo with your pointy heads.

31
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,001
Why are you always under boot?

32
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,845
What is this?

33
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,434
Have you checked the axis?
Is rotation balanced?

34
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,799
Can it be?

35
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:43,509
Dingle!

36
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,761
Make preparations.

37
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,930
We are going to have company.

38
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,872
Eighteen central incisors.

39
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:16,125
Moscow, sector 9.
22 incisors, 18 premolars.

40
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:17,877
Heavy rain advisory.

41
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,713
Des Moines, we've got a cuspid
at 23 Maple. Head out!

42
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,590
Wait! It's her first tooth.

43
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,717
Have you ever seen
a more adorable lateral incisor

44
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,885
in all of your life?

45
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,511
Look how she flossed.

46
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,270
My fellow Guardians,

47
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:40,566
it is our job to watch over
the children of the world

48
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,401
and keep them safe.

49
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:45,488
To bring wonder, hope, and dreams.

50
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,699
And so I have called us
all here for one reason,

51
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,743
and one reason only.

52
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,828
The children are in danger.

53
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,133
An enemy we have kept at bay
for centuries

54
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,969
has finally decided to strike back.

55
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:12,014
We alone can stop him.

56
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,396
It's freezing!

57
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,527
I can't feel my feet! I can't feel my feet!

58
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,446
Cookies? Eggnog? Anyone?

59
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:28,989
This better be good, North.

60
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,866
Sandy, thank you for coming.

61
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,035
I know, I know.

62
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,454
But I obviously wouldn't
have called you all here

63
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:36,997
unless it was serious.

64
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,669
The Boogeyman was here! At the Pole!

65
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,003
Pitch?

66
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,922
Pitch Black? Here?

67
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,006
Yes.

68
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,009
There was black sand
covering the Globe.

69
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,387
What do you mean, black sand?

70
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,222
And then a shadow!

71
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,182
Hold on, hold on.
I thought you said you saw Pitch.

72
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,309
Well, not exactly.

73
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,478
"Not exactly"? Can you believe this guy?

74
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,940
Yeah. You said it, Sandy.

75
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:06,694
Look, he's up to something very bad.

76
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,070
I feel it

77
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,489
in my belly.

78
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,284
Hang on, hang on. You mean
to say you summoned me here

79
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,162
three days before Easter
because of your belly?

80
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,487
Mate, if I did this
to you three days before Christmas...

81
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,500
Please, Bunny. Easter is not Christmas.

82
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,002
Here we go.

83
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,837
North, I don't have time for this!

84
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,131
I've still got two million eggs
to finish up!

85
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,134
No matter how much you paint,
is still egg.

86
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,927
Look, mate,
I'm dealing with perishables.

87
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,388
Right? You've got all year to prepare!

88
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,266
Why are rabbits always so nervous?

89
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,685
And why are you
always such a blowhard?

90
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,271
Tooth! Can't you see we're trying
to argue?

91
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,940
Sorry. Not all of us get
to work one night a year.

92
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,442
Am I right, Sandy?

93
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,527
San Diego, sector 2.

94
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,696
Come on, mate.
Pitch went out with the Dark Ages.

95
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,364
We made sure of it.

96
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,993
I know it was him.
We have serious situation.

97
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,370
Well, I've got a serious situation
with some eggs.

98
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,798
Man in Moon!

99
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,009
Sandy, why didn't you say something?

100
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,930
It's been a long time, old friend.

101
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,140
What is big news?

102
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,365
It is Pitch.

103
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:39,495
Manny, what must we do?

104
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,837
Guys, you know what this means?

105
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,090
He's choosing a new Guardian.

106
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,841
What? Why?

107
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,095
Must be big deal.
Manny thinks we need help.

108
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,347
Since when do we need help?

109
00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,765
I wonder who it's gonna be!

110
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,850
Maybe the Leprechaun?

111
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,018
Please not the Groundhog,
please not the Groundhog.

112
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,194
Jack Frost.

113
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,698
I take it back. The Groundhog's fine.

114
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,035
As long as he helps
to protect the children. Right?

115
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,247
Jack Frost?
He doesn't care about children!

116
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,707
All right? All he does
is freeze water pipes

117
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,792
and mess with my egg hunts!

118
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,677
All right?
He's an irresponsible, selfish...

119
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:29,962
Guardian.

120
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,755
Jack Frost is many things,

121
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,674
but he is not a Guardian.

122
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,868
Now that, that was fun.

123
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:01,994
Hey, wind!

124
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,914
Take me home.

125
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,761
Snow day!

126
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,767
It's freezing!

127
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,439
Yeah!

128
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,784
That looks interesting. Good book?

129
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,535
- All right!
- Yeah!

130
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,158
- Snow day!
- Snow day! Yeah.

131
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,455
You're welcome.

132
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,875
Guys, wait up! Are you guys coming
to the egg hunt Sunday?

133
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,335
Yeah! Free candy.

134
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,462
I hope we can find the eggs
with all this snow!

135
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,050
It says here that
they found Bigfoot hair samples

136
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,219
and DNA in Michigan!

137
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,845
That's like super-close!

138
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,138
Here we go again.

139
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,224
You saw the video too, Claude.
He's out there.

140
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,017
That's what you said about aliens.

141
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,769
And the Easter Bunny!

142
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,105
The Easter Bunny is real.

143
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,272
He's real all right.

144
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:15,150
Real annoying, real grumpy
and really full of himself.

145
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,836
Come on!
You guys will believe anything.

146
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,529
Easter Bunny, hop, hop, hop!

147
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,740
Mom, Sophie fell again!

148
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,200
You okay, Soph?

149
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,410
Jamie, hat.

150
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,662
We don't want Jack Frost
nipping at your nose.

151
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,080
Who's Jack Frost?

152
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,873
No one, honey. It's just an expression.

153
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:30,958
Hey!

154
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,878
"Who's Jack Frost?"

155
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,266
Okay, who threw that?

156
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,268
Well, it wasn't Bigfoot, kiddo.

157
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,440
Jamie Bennett, no fair!

158
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,233
You struck first!

159
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,236
Free-for-all!

160
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,364
All right, who needs ammo?

161
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,034
Look at that!

162
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,710
Crud! I hit Cupcake!

163
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,712
- She hit Cupcake.
- You hit Cupcake?

164
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,552
- Did you throw that?
- No.

165
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,095
It wasn't me!

166
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,939
A little slippery!

167
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,483
Jamie, watch out!

168
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,410
- That's the street!
- Stop! There's traffic!

169
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,614
Don't worry, Jamie. I got you. Hold on!

170
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,324
It's gonna be all right!

171
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,368
Keep up with me, kid! Take a left!

172
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,495
Hey, slow down!

173
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,539
Hold up. No, no, no, no.

174
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,082
Is that Jamie Bennett?

175
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,793
- There you go.
- No, no!

176
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,564
- Oh, my gosh!
- Yeah!

177
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,983
- That looks serious.
- Jamie, are you all right?

178
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,612
Did you guys see that? It was amazing!

179
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,782
I did a jump and I slid under a...

180
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,914
Cool! A tooth!

181
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,916
- Dude, that means cash!
- Tooth fairy cash!

182
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
- Oh, no!
- You lucky bum!

183
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,920
I got to put this under my pillow!

184
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,922
Oh, wait a minute.
Come on. Hold on, hold on.

185
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,423
What about all the fun we just had?

186
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,217
That wasn't the Tooth Fairy,
that was me!

187
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
My ears are freezing!

188
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,244
What's a guy got to do
to get a little attention around here?

189
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,933
There was a patch of ice.

190
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,560
I don't understand how it got here.

191
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,979
I mean, Easter is around the corner!

192
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,273
It was awesome!

193
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,607
So then I was flying down this hill

194
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,276
and it was like... through these cars

195
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,486
and then the sled hit this thing

196
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,029
and it was like way up in the air!

197
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,823
And then the sofa hit me...

198
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,492
and see, my tooth came out!

199
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,495
All right, you. Tooth under your pillow?

200
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,038
Yeah, I'm ready.

201
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,040
Now don't stay up trying
to see her, Jamie,

202
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,417
or she won't come.

203
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,044
But I can do it this time!
You want to help me, Soph?

204
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,337
We can hide and see the Tooth Fairy!

205
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,839
Hide, hide, hide, hide.

206
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,424
Straight to bed now, mister.

207
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,509
Mom.

208
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,732
If there's something I'm doing wrong,

209
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,403
can you just tell me what it is?

210
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,740
Because I've tried everything

211
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,368
and no one ever sees me.

212
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,333
You put me here.

213
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,668
The least you can do is tell me...

214
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,546
Tell me why.

215
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,741
Right on time, Sandman.

216
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:11,071
I thought I heard
the clippity-clop of a unicorn.

217
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,116
What an adorable dream!

218
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:17,077
And look at her.

219
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,454
Precious child.

220
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,124
So sweet.

221
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,334
So full of hope and wonder.

222
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,713
Why, there's only one thing missing.

223
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:29,464
A touch of fear.

224
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,303
That never gets old.

225
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:40,100
Feel your fear. Come on.
Come on, that's right.

226
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:45,814
Yes, what a pretty little Nightmare!

227
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,150
Now,

228
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:52,571
I want you to go tell the others
the wait is over.

229
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,289
Don't look at me like that, old friend.

230
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,125
You must have known
this day would come.

231
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,627
My Nightmares are finally ready.

232
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,380
Are your Guardians?

233
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:41,953
Hello, mate.

234
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,833
Been a long time.
Blizzard of '68 I believe.

235
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,294
Easter Sunday, wasn't it?

236
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:53,131
Bunny! You're not still
mad about that, are you?

237
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:54,508
Yes.

238
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,677
But this is about something else.

239
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,387
Fellas?

240
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,014
Hey!

241
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,265
Put me down! What the...

242
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,316
Me?

243
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,277
Not on your nelly.
See you back at the Pole.

244
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,416
He's here.

245
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,086
Quiet.

246
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,088
Hey! There he is!

247
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,465
Jack Frost!

248
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,760
You got to be kidding me.

249
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,303
Hey, hey.

250
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:43,515
- Put me down.
- I hope the yetis treated you well.

251
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,683
Oh, yeah,

252
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,769
I love being shoved in a sack
and tossed through a magic portal.

253
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,188
Oh, good. That was my idea!

254
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,731
You know Bunny, obviously.

255
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:53,859
- Obviously.
- And the Tooth Fairy.

256
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,544
Hello, Jack. I've heard a lot about you.

257
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,987
And your teeth!

258
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,154
My what?

259
00:19:58,281 --> 00:19:59,573
Open up!
Are they really as white as they say?

260
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:00,657
Yes!

261
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,577
They really do sparkle
like freshly fallen snow!

262
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,329
Girls, pull yourselves together!

263
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,695
Let's not disgrace the uniform.

264
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,207
And Sandman.

265
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:10,500
Sandy?

266
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,335
Sandy? Wake up!

267
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:15,547
Hey, anyone want
to tell me why I'm here?

268
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,386
That's not really helping,

269
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,846
but thanks, little man.

270
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,308
I must've done something really bad
to get you four together.

271
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,893
Am I on the naughty list?

272
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,145
On naughty list?

273
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,646
You hold the record.

274
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,565
But, no matter. We overlook.

275
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,901
Now we are wiping clean the slate.

276
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,319
How come?

277
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,403
Good question.

278
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,573
How come? I tell you how come!

279
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,117
Because now you are Guardian!

280
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,294
What are you doing? Get off of me!

281
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,378
This is the best part!

282
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,253
What makes you think
I want to be a Guardian?

283
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,252
Of course you do.

284
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,504
Music!

285
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,215
No music!

286
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,760
This is all very flattering, but,

287
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,637
you don't want me.

288
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,473
You're all hard work and deadlines,

289
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,642
and I'm snowballs and fun times.

290
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,185
I'm not a Guardian.

291
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,979
Yeah. That's exactly what I said.

292
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:57,023
Jack, I don't think
you understand what it is we do.

293
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,859
Each of those lights is a child.

294
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:02,529
A child who believes.

295
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,240
And good or bad, naughty or nice,

296
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:07,033
we protect them.

297
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:10,078
Tooth! Fingers out of mouth.

298
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,415
Sorry. They're beautiful.

299
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,000
Okay. No more wishy-washy.

300
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,127
Pitch is out there
doing who knows what!

301
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,045
You mean the Boogeyman?

302
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,965
Yes! When Pitch threatens us,

303
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,633
he threatens them as well.

304
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:25,468
All the more reason
to pick someone more qualified.

305
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,512
Pick? You think we pick?

306
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,890
No, you were chosen!
Like we were all chosen.

307
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,267
By Man in Moon.

308
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,560
What?

309
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,603
Last night, Jack, he chose you.

310
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:36,771
Maybe.

311
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:40,400
Man in the Moon... He talks to you?

312
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:45,822
You see, you cannot say no.
It is destiny.

313
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,618
But why wouldn't he tell me
that himself?

314
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,831
After 300 years this is his answer?

315
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,167
To spend eternity like you guys,

316
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:01,963
cooped up in some hideout thinking
of new ways to bribe kids?

317
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:06,760
No, no. That's not for me! No offense.

318
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,262
How is that not offensive?

319
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,472
You know what I think?

320
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,015
I think we just dodged a bullet.

321
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,141
I mean, what's this clown

322
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,144
know about bringing joy
to children anyway.

323
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,605
You ever hear of a snow day?

324
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,941
I know it's no hard-boiled egg,
but kids like what I do.

325
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,152
But none of them
believe in you, do they?

326
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,904
You see, you're invisible, mate.

327
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,281
It's like you don't even exist.

328
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,657
Bunny! Enough.

329
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,993
No, the kangaroo's right.

330
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,037
The what? What did you call me?

331
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,122
I'm not a kangaroo, mate.

332
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,666
Oh, and this whole time
I thought you were.

333
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:41,920
If you're not a kangaroo, what are you?

334
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:45,381
I'm a bunny. The Easter Bunny.

335
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,301
People believe in me.

336
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,060
Jack. Walk with me.

337
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,271
It's nothing personal, North.

338
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,482
But what you all do,
it's just not my thing.

339
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,442
Man in Moon says it is your thing!

340
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:05,610
We will see.

341
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,946
Slow down, would you?
I've been trying to bust in here for years.

342
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,990
- I want a good look.
- What do you mean, bust in?

343
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,033
Don't worry. I never got past the yetis.

344
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,451
Hey, Phil.

345
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,121
Keep up, Jack, keep up!

346
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,674
I always thought
the elves made the toys.

347
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:30,176
We just let them believe that.

348
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,683
Very nice! Keep up good work.

349
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,018
I don't like it! Paint it red!

350
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,355
Step it up, everybody!

351
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,750
Fruitcake?

352
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,711
No, thanks.

353
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,423
Now we get down to tacks of brass.

354
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,300
Tacks of...

355
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,597
Who are you, Jack Frost?

356
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,766
- What is your center?
- My center?

357
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,811
If Man in Moon chose you
to be a Guardian,

358
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:25,023
you must have something
very special inside.

359
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,322
Here.

360
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,407
This is how you see me, no?

361
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,076
Very big, intimidating.

362
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:41,331
But if you get to know me a little...
Well, go on.

363
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,128
You are downright jolly?

364
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,215
But not just jolly!

365
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,759
I am also mysterious,

366
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:56,804
and fearless,

367
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,766
and caring!

368
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,352
And at my center?

369
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:07,106
There's a tiny wooden baby.

370
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:09,943
Look closer. What do you see?

371
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,320
You have big eyes.

372
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,490
Yes! Big eyes. Very big.

373
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,159
Because they are full of wonder.

374
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,578
That is my center.

375
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,414
It is what I was born with.

376
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:28,002
Eyes that have always seen
the wonder in everything!

377
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:32,590
Eyes that see lights in the trees
and magic in the air.

378
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:38,179
This wonder is what I put into the world!

379
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,224
And what I protect in children.

380
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,810
It is what makes me a Guardian.

381
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,814
It is my center.

382
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:50,316
What is yours?

383
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,279
I don't know.

384
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,872
We have a problem, mate.
Trouble at the Tooth Palace.

385
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,250
North! North!

386
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,585
I told you I'm not going with you guys!

387
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,880
There is no way
I'm climbing into some rickety old...

388
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,303
sleigh?

389
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,160
Okay. One ride, but that's it.

390
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,412
Everyone loves the sleigh!

391
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,414
Bunny, what are you waiting for?

392
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:50,168
I think my tunnels might be faster,
mate, and safer.

393
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:51,836
Get in!

394
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,379
Buckle up!

395
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:55,089
Where are the bloody seatbelts?

396
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:58,384
That was just expression.
Are we ready?

397
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,928
Good. Let's go! Clear!

398
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,435
Out of the way!

399
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,821
Oh, no!

400
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,411
Slow down! Slow down!

401
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,958
I hope you like the loopty-loops.

402
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:33,086
I hope you like carrots.

403
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,380
Here we go!

404
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,061
Blastoff!

405
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:57,860
Hey, Bunny.

406
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:00,029
Check out this view.

407
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,240
North! He's...

408
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,161
You do care.

409
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:09,956
Rack off, you bloody show pony!

410
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,833
Hold on, everyone! I know a shortcut.

411
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:14,794
Strewth, I knew I should've taken
the tunnels.

412
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,005
I say Tooth Palace.

413
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:26,848
What?

414
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:32,353
What are they?

415
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,306
They're taking the tooth fairies!

416
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,536
Hey, little Baby Tooth, you okay?

417
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,803
Here, take over.

418
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,518
They're stealing the teeth!

419
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,565
Jack, look out!

420
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,032
Tooth! Are you all right?

421
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:29,410
They... They took my fairies.

422
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:31,412
And the teeth! All of them!

423
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:33,080
Everything is gone.

424
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,249
Everything.

425
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,715
Oh, thank goodness.
One of you is all right.

426
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,552
I have to say, this is very, very exciting.

427
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,972
The Big Four, all in one place.

428
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,475
I'm a little starstruck.

429
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,436
Did you like my show
on the Globe, North?

430
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,939
Got you all together, didn't I?

431
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:01,692
Pitch! You have got 30 seconds
to return my fairies!

432
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:05,780
Or what?
You'll stick a quarter under my pillow?

433
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:07,615
Why are you doing this?

434
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,993
Maybe I want what you have.

435
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,411
To be believed in.

436
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:17,625
Maybe I'm tired of hiding under beds!

437
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:19,544
Maybe that's where you belong!

438
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:21,963
Go suck an egg, rabbit.

439
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:26,759
Hang on. Is that Jack Frost?

440
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,888
Since when are you all so chummy?

441
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:32,014
We're not.

442
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:34,809
Good. A neutral party.

443
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,311
Then I'm going to ignore you.

444
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,939
But you must be used to that by now.

445
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,108
Pitch, you shadow-sneaking ratbag,
come here!

446
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,618
Hey! Easy, girl, easy.

447
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,331
Look familiar, Sandman?

448
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:00,167
Took me a while
to perfect this little trick.

449
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,962
Turning dreams into Nightmares.

450
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:05,631
Don't be nervous.

451
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:09,885
It only riles them up more.
They smell fear, you know.

452
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,138
What fear? Of you?

453
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:15,057
No one's been afraid of you
since the Dark Ages!

454
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,685
The Dark Ages.

455
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:20,855
Everyone frightened. Miserable.

456
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:26,027
Such happy times for me.
The power I wielded.

457
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,778
But then the Man in the Moon

458
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:32,366
chose you to replace my fear
with your wonder and light.

459
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,246
Lifting their hearts
and giving them hope.

460
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:41,292
Meanwhile, everyone
wrote me off as just a bad dream!

461
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,793
"There's nothing to be afraid of."

462
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,421
"There's no such thing
as the Boogeyman!"

463
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,550
Well, that's all about to change.

464
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,055
Look.

465
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,307
It's happening already.

466
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,391
What is?

467
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:03,189
Children are waking up and realizing

468
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:05,399
the Tooth Fairy never came.

469
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,987
I mean, such a little thing.
But to a child...

470
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,573
What's going on?

471
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:15,785
They... They don't
believe in me anymore.

472
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,788
Didn't they tell you, Jack?

473
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:21,374
It's great being a Guardian.

474
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:22,917
But there's a catch.

475
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,127
If enough kids stop believing,

476
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,533
everything your friends protect,

477
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:30,341
wonder, hopes and dreams,
it all goes away.

478
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,386
And little by little, so do they.

479
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,348
No Christmas or Easter,

480
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,226
or little fairies that come in the night.

481
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:45,815
There will be nothing
but fear and darkness.

482
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,608
And me.

483
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,320
It's your turn not to be believed in.

484
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,675
He's gone.

485
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,264
Okay, all right, I admit it.

486
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:20,182
You were right about Pitch.

487
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,101
I'm sorry about the fairies.

488
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:26,397
You should have seen them.
They put up such a fight.

489
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,192
Why would Pitch take the teeth?

490
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,737
It's not the teeth he wanted.

491
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,196
It's the memories inside them.

492
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,323
What do you mean?

493
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,201
That's why we collect the teeth, Jack.

494
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:43,038
They hold the most important memories
of childhood.

495
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,543
My fairies and I watch over them.

496
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,879
And when someone needs
to remember what's important,

497
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,298
we help them.

498
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,010
We had everyone's here.

499
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:58,846
Yours, too.

500
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,056
My memories?

501
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:02,767
From when you were young.

502
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:05,102
Before you became Jack Frost.

503
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:08,814
But I wasn't anyone before
I was Jack Frost.

504
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:10,900
Of course you were.

505
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:13,152
We were all someone
before we were chosen.

506
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:16,113
What?

507
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:17,279
You should have seen Bunny.

508
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,366
I told you never to mention that!

509
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,703
The night at the pond, I just...
I assumed...

510
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:24,955
Are you saying...

511
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,916
Are you saying I had a life before that,

512
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,503
with a home and a family?

513
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,672
You really don't remember?

514
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,259
All these years,
the answers were right here.

515
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,553
If I find my memories,
then I'll know why I'm here.

516
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,222
You have to show me!

517
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,724
I can't, Jack. Pitch has them.

518
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:46,435
Then we have to get them back!

519
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,230
Oh, no.

520
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,525
The children!

521
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:54,944
We're too late!

522
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,112
No! No!

523
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,073
No such thing as too late!

524
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,829
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

525
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,248
Idea!

526
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,918
We will collect the teeth.

527
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,086
What?

528
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:14,797
We get teeth,
children keep believing in you!

529
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,007
We're talking seven continents
and millions of kids!

530
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,384
Give me break.

531
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,928
You know how many toys
I deliver in one night?

532
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,347
And eggs I hide in one day?

533
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,892
And, Jack, if you help us,

534
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,770
we will get you your memories.

535
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:38,779
I'm in.

536
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,283
Quickly! Quickly!

537
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:45,286
Hop to it, rabbit! I'm five teeth ahead!

538
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,705
Yeah, right.
Look, I'd tell you to stay out of my way,

539
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:48,998
but, really, what's the point?

540
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,291
'Cause you won't be
able to keep up anyway.

541
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,959
Is that a challenge, cottontail?

542
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,647
You don't want to race a rabbit, mate.

543
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,590
A race? Is it a race?

544
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:00,426
This is going to be epic!

545
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,720
Four bicuspids over there!
An incisor two blocks east.

546
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:04,244
Is that a molar? They're everywhere!

547
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:06,682
You okay?

548
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,809
I'm fine. Sorry.

549
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,145
It's been a really long time
since I've been out in the field.

550
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,563
How long is a long time?

551
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,690
440 years, give or take.

552
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,494
Twins!

553
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,663
Jackpot!

554
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,250
Looks like you're a bit of a brumby,
mate?

555
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,337
Is piece of pie.

556
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:42,259
That's my tooth! Sandy! Sandy!

557
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:50,809
Take it easy there, champ.

558
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:53,520
He's one of us!
Part of the European division.

559
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,326
Crikey!

560
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,537
Yes!

561
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:11,747
No!

562
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,759
You guys collect teeth
and leave gifts

563
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,678
as fast as my fairies.

564
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,031
You guys have been leaving gifts, right?

565
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:05,759
The lights.

566
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,971
Why aren't they going out?

567
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,766
They're collecting the teeth?

568
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,773
Pipe down or I'll stuff a pillow with you!

569
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:26,697
Fine. Have your last hurrah.

570
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,282
For tomorrow,

571
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,951
all your pathetic scrambling
will be for nothing.

572
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,372
Left central incisor,

573
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:37,666
knocked out in
a freak sledding accident.

574
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,627
I wonder how that
could've happened, Jack.

575
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,464
Kids?

576
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:49,803
This was always the part I liked most.

577
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,389
Seeing the kids.

578
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,272
Why did I ever stop doing this?

579
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,693
It's a little different up close?

580
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:07,946
Thanks for being here, Jack.

581
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:10,491
I wish I'd known about your memory.

582
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:12,117
I could have helped you.

583
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:13,827
Yeah, well...

584
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:15,913
Look, let's just get you taken care of.

585
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,498
Then it's Pitch's turn.

586
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:18,624
Here you are!

587
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,924
What gives, slowpokes?

588
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,759
How you feeling, Toothy?

589
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:30,511
Believed in.

590
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:32,846
That's what I want to hear.

591
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,516
I see how it is. All working together

592
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,559
to make sure the rabbit gets last place.

593
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:41,105
You think I need help to beat a bunny?

594
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,856
Check it out, Peter Cottontail.

595
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,358
You call that a bag of choppers?

596
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,777
Now that's a bag of choppers.

597
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,821
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
This is about Tooth.

598
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:50,531
It's not a competition.

599
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,200
But if it was, I win!

600
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:57,371
Oh, no.

601
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,414
Santa Claus?

602
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,708
The Easter Bunny?

603
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,002
Sandman?

604
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:06,964
The Tooth Fairy! I knew you'd come!

605
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,341
Surprise! We came.

606
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,093
He can see us?

607
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,388
Most of us.

608
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,104
You guys, he's still awake.

609
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:23,647
Sandy, knock him out.

610
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,984
With the Dreamsand, you gumbies!

611
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,737
No, stop! That's the Easter Bunny!

612
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,239
What are you doing, Abbey? Down!

613
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,074
All right, nobody panic.

614
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:36,660
But that's a greyhound.

615
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,662
Do you know what
greyhounds do to rabbits?

616
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,665
I think it's a pretty safe bet
he's never met a rabbit like me.

617
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,083
Six-foot-one,

618
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:44,376
nerves of steel.

619
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,587
Master of tai-chi
and the ancient art of...

620
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:48,255
Crikey!

621
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,174
Stop! Sit!

622
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:51,383
Down, girl, down!

623
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,971
Sandy!

624
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,644
She's rabid! Get this dingo off me!

625
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,771
Oh, no.

626
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,568
Candy canes...

627
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:22,247
I really wish I had a camera right now.

628
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,006
Sandy, come on! We can find Pitch!

629
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,274
Pretty.

630
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,861
Bunny, hop, hop, hop!

631
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:04,414
What...

632
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:13,715
Yes!

633
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:37,197
I got it.

634
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,326
Sandy!

635
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,370
Sandy, did you see that?

636
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,290
Look at this thing.

637
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,209
Frost?

638
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,130
You know, for a neutral party,

639
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:56,049
you spend an awful lot of time
with those weirdos.

640
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:58,552
This isn't your fight, Jack.

641
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,640
You made it my fight
when you stole those teeth!

642
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:03,348
Teeth? Why do you
care about the teeth?

643
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,271
Now this is who I'm looking for.

644
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:29,499
Remind me not to get on your bad side.

645
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:32,669
Okay, easy.
You can't blame me for trying, Sandy.

646
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:36,548
You don't know what it's like
to be weak and hated.

647
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:39,593
It was stupid of me
to mess with your dreams.

648
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,428
So, I'll tell you what.

649
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,347
You can have them back.

650
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,153
You take the ones on the left,

651
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,905
I'll take the ones on the right?

652
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,410
Come on!

653
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,880
You might want to duck.

654
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:13,103
We've got to help Sandy!

655
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:21,319
No!

656
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,529
Jack!

657
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:26,616
Don't fight the fear, little man!

658
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:31,955
Hurry! Hurry, Jack!

659
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:35,917
I'd say "sweet dreams,"
but there aren't any left.

660
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,096
Sandy?

661
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,515
No!

662
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,545
Jack!

663
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:25,175
Jack, how did you do that?

664
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:28,929
I didn't know I could.

665
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:40,607
Finally!

666
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,944
Someone who knows
how to have a little fun!

667
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,087
Are you all right?

668
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,255
I just...

669
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,341
I wish I could've done something.

670
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:49,634
Done something?

671
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:52,971
Jack, you stood up to Pitch.
You saved us!

672
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,180
But Sandy...

673
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,683
Would be proud of what you did.

674
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,356
I don't know who you were
in your past life.

675
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:06,359
But in this life, you are Guardian.

676
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:11,781
But how can I know who I am
until I find out who I was?

677
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:13,700
You will.

678
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:15,785
I feel it

679
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,662
in my belly.

680
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,542
Look how fast they're going out.

681
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,669
It's fear.

682
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,714
He's tipped the balance.

683
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,552
Hey, buck up, you sad sacks!

684
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:36,139
We can still turn this around!

685
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,059
Easter is tomorrow.

686
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:43,355
And I need your help.
I say we pull out all the stops

687
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:46,066
and we get those little lights
flickering again.

688
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,029
Bunny is right.

689
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,782
As much as it pains me
to say, old friend,

690
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:57,952
this time, Easter is more
important than Christmas.

691
00:49:58,204 --> 00:49:59,496
Hey, did everyone hear that?

692
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:02,749
We must hurry to the warren.
Everyone! To the sleigh!

693
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:06,294
Oh, no, mate.
My warren, my rules. Buckle up.

694
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:08,254
Shostakovich!

695
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:21,893
"Buckle up." Is very funny.

696
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,854
Welcome to the warren.

697
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:30,610
Something's up.

698
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,296
Sophie?

699
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:56,052
- Elf, elf, elf!
- What is she doing here?

700
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,263
Snow globe.

701
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:00,014
Crikey! Somebody do something.

702
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,392
Don't look at me.
I'm invisible, remember?

703
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:03,893
Elf! Elf!

704
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:06,730
Don't worry, Bunny.
I bet she's a fairy fan.

705
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,815
- It's okay, little one.
- Pretty.

706
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,609
You know what?
I've got something for you!

707
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,153
Here it is!

708
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,196
Look at all the pretty teeth,

709
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:16,948
with little blood and gum on them!

710
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,162
Blood and gums?

711
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:23,371
When was the last time

712
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,582
you guys actually hung out with kids?

713
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:26,833
Peek-a-boo!

714
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,919
We are very busy bringing joy
to children.

715
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:31,838
We don't have time...

716
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,799
For children.

717
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,678
If one little kid can ruin Easter,

718
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:41,014
then we're in worse shape
than I thought.

719
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:52,066
You want to paint some eggs? Yeah?

720
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:54,319
- Okay.
- Come on.

721
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:01,326
Rimsky-Korsakov!

722
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:02,911
That's a lot of eggs.

723
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,871
How much time do we have?

724
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,670
All right, troops, it's time to push back.

725
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:15,799
That means eggs everywhere!

726
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:17,884
Heaps of you in every high-rise,

727
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:20,011
farmhouse, and trailer park!

728
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,972
In tennis shoes and cereal bowls.

729
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:26,392
Oh, there will be bathtubs filled
with my beautiful googies!

730
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,487
Okay, that's a little strange.

731
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,738
No, mate.

732
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:40,406
That's adorable.

733
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:46,412
There will be springtime!
On every continent!

734
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:49,040
And I'm bringing hope with me!

735
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:00,218
Too Christmas-y, mate.
Paint them blue.

736
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,056
What's over there?

737
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,852
That's a beauty!

738
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:11,437
Now, all we got to do is get him
and his little mates

739
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,231
through the tunnels to the top

740
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:16,067
and we'll have ourselves Easter.

741
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:28,913
Not bad.

742
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:33,126
Not bad yourself.

743
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:38,381
Look, I'm sorry about the whole...

744
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:40,592
You know, the kangaroo thing.

745
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:42,927
It's the accent, isn't it?

746
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:47,891
Poor little ankle-biter.
Look at her. All tuckered out.

747
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:49,642
I love her.

748
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,229
I think it's time to get her home.

749
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:54,480
How about I take her home?

750
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,650
- Jack, no. Pitch is...
- No match for this.

751
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:00,486
Which is why we need you here with us.

752
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:03,865
Trust me. I'll be quick as a bunny.

753
00:54:18,631 --> 00:54:20,465
Sophie? Is that you?

754
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:28,973
We should get back.

755
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:31,434
Jack!

756
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:35,897
That voice, I know that voice.

757
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:36,523
Jack!

758
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:03,424
Don't worry, there's still time.

759
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,355
Jack?

760
00:55:27,116 --> 00:55:28,866
Baby Tooth, come on!

761
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,160
I have to find out what that is.

762
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,509
Keep it down!

763
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:47,969
I'm gonna get you
out of here just as soon as...

764
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,053
Jack?

765
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,056
Jack!

766
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,434
As I can.

767
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:02,775
Looking for something?

768
00:56:07,448 --> 00:56:10,783
Don't be afraid, Jack.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

769
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:14,037
Afraid? I'm not afraid of you.

770
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:16,956
Maybe not.
But you are afraid of something.

771
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:19,751
- You think so?
- I know so!

772
00:56:20,753 --> 00:56:23,004
It's the one thing I always know.

773
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,089
People's greatest fears.

774
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:28,426
Yours is that no one
will ever believe in you.

775
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:36,851
And worst of all,
you're afraid you'll never know why.

776
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:38,144
Why you?

777
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:42,982
Why were you chosen to be like this?

778
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,859
Well, fear not.

779
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:47,487
For the answer to that is right here.

780
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:53,993
Do you want them, Jack?
Your memories?

781
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:06,714
Everything you wanted to know,
in this little box.

782
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:11,344
Why did you end up like this? Unseen.

783
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,721
Unable to reach out to anyone.

784
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:17,475
You want the answers so badly.
You want to grab them

785
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:19,936
and fly off with them. But you're afraid

786
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:22,313
of what the Guardians will think.

787
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,357
You're afraid of disappointing them.

788
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:26,526
Well, let me ease your mind
about one thing.

789
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:29,070
They'll never accept you. Not really.

790
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,364
Stop it!

791
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:34,283
After all, you're not one of them.

792
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:35,993
You don't know what I am.

793
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,162
Of course I do! You're Jack Frost.

794
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:40,373
You make a mess wherever you go.

795
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:42,208
Why, you're doing it right now.

796
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:45,419
What did you do?

797
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:48,381
More to the point, Jack,
what did you do?

798
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:58,266
Baby Tooth!

799
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:01,310
Happy Easter, Jack.

800
00:58:05,858 --> 00:58:07,233
No.

801
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:09,443
There aren't any eggs.

802
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,028
- There's nothing here.
- I give up.

803
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:13,239
- He didn't come.
- I don't understand.

804
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,825
Maybe he just hid them
really well this year.

805
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,994
- Kids, oi!
- I checked everywhere. There's nothing.

806
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:19,620
Yes, there is! There is!

807
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:21,164
I mean, these aren't
my best looking googies,

808
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:22,456
but they'll do in a pinch.

809
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:23,833
I can't believe it.

810
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:25,209
I know.

811
00:58:25,294 --> 00:58:28,129
There's no such thing
as the Easter Bunny.

812
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,839
What? No.

813
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,883
Wrong! Not true!

814
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:34,415
- I'm right in front of you, mate.
- Why wouldn't he come?

815
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:40,808
They don't see me.

816
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:47,398
Jack, where were you?

817
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,902
The Nightmares attacked the tunnels.

818
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:54,488
They smashed every egg,
crushed every basket.

819
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:56,908
Nothing made it to the surface.

820
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:58,910
Jack.

821
00:59:00,621 --> 00:59:02,955
Where did you get that?

822
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,457
I was... It's...

823
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:05,958
Where's Baby Tooth?

824
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:10,421
Jack, what have you done?

825
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:13,090
That is why you weren't here?

826
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,760
You were with Pitch?

827
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,470
No, listen, listen.

828
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:21,098
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean for this to happen.

829
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,100
- He has to go.
- What?

830
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:25,311
We should never have trusted you!

831
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:33,027
Easter is new beginnings, new life.

832
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:36,948
Easter's about hope.

833
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,492
And now it's gone.

834
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,359
Let's check the park again.

835
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,569
- Really?
- For what? The Easter Bunny?

836
01:00:15,654 --> 01:00:17,571
Guys, I told you, I saw him!

837
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:18,856
He's way bigger than I thought

838
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,908
and he's got these cool
boomerang things!

839
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:23,828
- Grow up, Jamie.
- Oh, man. Seriously?

840
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,333
What's happened to you guys?

841
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,544
It was a dream!

842
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,754
You should be happy
you still get dreams like that

843
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:35,172
and not...

844
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,092
Nightmares.

845
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,680
Forget it, Jamie.

846
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,809
There's just no Easter this year.

847
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:49,186
He really is real!

848
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,231
I know he is.

849
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,261
I thought this might happen.

850
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:25,348
They never really believed in you.

851
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:27,725
I was just trying to show you that.

852
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:29,435
But I understand.

853
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:33,481
You don't understand anything!

854
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:37,276
No? I don't know what it's like
to be cast out?

855
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,824
To not be believed in?

856
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:48,120
To long for a family.

857
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:53,542
All those years in the shadows I thought

858
01:01:53,627 --> 01:01:56,295
no one else knows what this feels like.

859
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,964
But now I see I was wrong.

860
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,969
We don't have to be alone, Jack.

861
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:08,057
I believe in you.
And I know children will, too.

862
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,184
In me?

863
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:11,477
Yes!

864
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:14,438
Look at what we can do.

865
01:02:15,023 --> 01:02:18,359
What goes together
better than cold and dark?

866
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:20,194
We can make them believe.

867
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:23,906
We'll give them a world
where everything, everything is...

868
01:02:24,116 --> 01:02:25,449
Pitch black?

869
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,661
And Jack Frost, too.

870
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:30,955
They'll believe in both of us.

871
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:34,500
No, they'll fear both of us.
And that's not what I want.

872
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:36,710
Now for the last time,

873
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,796
leave me alone.

874
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:45,970
Very well. You want to be left alone.
Done. But first...

875
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:50,182
Baby Tooth!

876
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:53,894
The staff, Jack!

877
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:58,441
You have a bad habit of interfering.

878
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:02,528
Now, hand it over, and I'll let her go.

879
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:20,337
All right.

880
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:21,964
Now let her go.

881
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:24,508
No.

882
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:28,053
You said you wanted to be alone.

883
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,555
So be alone!

884
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:34,059
No!

885
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,044
Baby Tooth!

886
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:02,505
You all right?

887
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,929
Sorry. All I can do is keep you cold.

888
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:14,058
Pitch was right.

889
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:17,811
I make a mess of everything.

890
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:22,358
Hey.

891
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,745
Jack?

892
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:36,122
Jack!

893
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:00,563
Come on, Jack,

894
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:02,022
you can't have fun all the time.

895
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:03,440
Jack, get down from there.

896
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:05,651
- Jack!
- You're funny, Jack.

897
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:07,903
Be careful.

898
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:10,990
We will.

899
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:20,583
It's okay. It's okay.

900
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:23,002
Don't look down. Just look at me.

901
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:24,378
Jack.

902
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,338
I'm scared.

903
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:29,174
I know. I know.

904
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:35,180
But you're gonna be all right.
You're not gonna fall in.

905
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,058
We're gonna have a little fun instead!

906
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:39,602
No, we're not!

907
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,061
Would I trick you?

908
01:05:41,229 --> 01:05:42,980
Yes! You always play tricks!

909
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:46,191
Well, not this time.

910
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:48,485
I promise, I promise. You're gonna be...

911
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:50,487
You're gonna be fine.

912
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:52,531
You have to believe in me.

913
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:57,953
You want to play a game?
We're gonna play hopscotch!

914
01:05:58,038 --> 01:05:59,371
Like we play every day.

915
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,206
It's as easy as

916
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:03,042
one...

917
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,421
Two.

918
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:09,089
Three!

919
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,634
All right.

920
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,218
Now it's your turn.

921
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:14,511
One...

922
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:16,013
That's it, that's it.

923
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:17,681
Two.

924
01:06:17,766 --> 01:06:18,766
Three!

925
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:27,900
Jack!

926
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:54,385
Did you see... Did you see that?

927
01:06:56,096 --> 01:06:57,179
It was me!

928
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:59,431
I had a family! I had a sister!

929
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,517
I saved her!

930
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,230
That's why you chose me.

931
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:10,943
I'm a Guardian.

932
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:17,950
We have to get out of here.

933
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:28,794
Okay.

934
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:51,275
Come on, Baby Tooth, I owe you one!

935
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:54,611
Come on! Let's go!

936
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:57,906
What's wrong?

937
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:01,702
None of you can fly?

938
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,456
The lights.

939
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:19,428
You're all free to go!

940
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:22,389
We won't be needing
any Christmas toys this year,

941
01:08:22,474 --> 01:08:23,891
thank you.

942
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:25,726
Nor ever again.

943
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,525
They're all going out.

944
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:35,569
Only six left.

945
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:37,446
Six precious children

946
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:41,116
who still believe in the Guardians
with all their hearts.

947
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:43,327
Make that

948
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:44,453
five.

949
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:48,832
Four.

950
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,959
Three!

951
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,045
Two!

952
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:02,387
One.

953
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:06,934
Jamie.

954
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:14,858
Okay, look,

955
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:18,779
you and I are obviously
at what they call a crossroads.

956
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:20,864
So here's what's gonna happen.

957
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:25,035
If it wasn't a dream and if you are real

958
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:29,581
then you have to prove it, like, right now.

959
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:41,677
I've believed in you
for a long time, okay?

960
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:44,137
Like, my whole life, in fact.

961
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,515
So you kind of owe me now.

962
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:50,435
You don't have to do much.
Just a little sign so I know.

963
01:09:52,981 --> 01:09:54,314
Anything.

964
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:56,316
Anything at all.

965
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:04,825
I knew it.

966
01:10:36,316 --> 01:10:37,816
He's real!

967
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,754
Snow?

968
01:11:06,888 --> 01:11:09,056
Jack Frost.

969
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:11,141
Did he just say...

970
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:13,018
Jack Frost?

971
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:16,104
He said it again. He said...

972
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:17,189
You said...

973
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:21,526
Jack Frost!

974
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,028
That's right!

975
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:26,865
But that's me! Jack Frost!
That's my name!

976
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:28,951
You said my name!

977
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:34,498
Wait. Can you hear me?

978
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:37,125
Can you...

979
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:39,002
Can you see me?

980
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:44,675
He sees me! He sees me!

981
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:49,221
- You just made it snow!
- I know!

982
01:11:49,389 --> 01:11:51,014
- In my room!
- I know!

983
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,641
- You're real?
- Yeah!

984
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:55,477
Who do you think brings you
all the blizzards and the snow days?

985
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,771
And you remember when you went
flying on that sled the other day?

986
01:11:57,939 --> 01:11:59,648
- That was you?
- That was me!

987
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:01,191
- Cool!
- Right?

988
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,735
But what about the Easter Bunny?
And the Tooth Fairy?

989
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:07,197
Real, real, real! Every one of us is real.

990
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:10,742
- I knew it!
- Jamie, who are you talking to?

991
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:14,496
Jack Frost?

992
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:17,207
Okay.

993
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:32,848
Come back!

994
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:35,350
- North, are you okay?
- Is official.

995
01:12:35,435 --> 01:12:37,227
My powers are kaput.

996
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:39,479
Look!

997
01:12:40,648 --> 01:12:43,442
Jack!

998
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:45,360
Are you okay?

999
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:47,988
What are you doing here?

1000
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:50,157
Same as you.

1001
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:54,619
The last light.

1002
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:58,623
It is you! I mean, it is you!

1003
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:01,835
I knew it wasn't a dream!

1004
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:05,922
Jack, he sees you.

1005
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:09,926
Wait. But where's Bunny?

1006
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:13,096
Losing Easter took its toll on all of us.

1007
01:13:13,848 --> 01:13:15,182
Bunny most of all.

1008
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:21,354
Oh, no.

1009
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:25,984
That's the Easter Bunny?

1010
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:27,736
Now somebody sees me!

1011
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,988
Where were you about an hour ago,
mate?

1012
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:31,490
What happened to him?

1013
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:34,409
He used to be huge and cool.
And now he's...

1014
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:36,244
Cute.

1015
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:38,497
That's good.

1016
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:40,916
Did you tell him to say that? That's it!

1017
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,168
Let's go! Me and you! Come on!

1018
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:45,712
No. Actually, he told me you were real.

1019
01:13:45,797 --> 01:13:48,340
Just when I started to think
that maybe you weren't.

1020
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,301
He made you believe?

1021
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:53,512
In me?

1022
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:10,070
Get Jamie out of here.

1023
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:11,863
Be careful, Jack.

1024
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:17,119
Jack Frost.

1025
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:20,080
Let's end this, shall we?

1026
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:26,211
That little trick doesn't work
on me anymore.

1027
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:33,552
This way, this way.

1028
01:14:34,554 --> 01:14:36,680
Dead end. Other way, other way!

1029
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:41,518
Jack!

1030
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:46,523
That was good try, Jack. "A" for effort.

1031
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:49,276
He's stronger. I can't beat him.

1032
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:57,951
All this fuss over one little boy,

1033
01:14:58,077 --> 01:15:01,079
and still he refuses to stop believing.

1034
01:15:01,164 --> 01:15:03,957
Very well. There are other ways

1035
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:06,084
to snuff out a light.

1036
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:10,755
If you want him, you're gonna have
to go through me.

1037
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:14,426
Look how fluffy you are.

1038
01:15:14,969 --> 01:15:16,970
Would you like a scratch behind
the ears?

1039
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:18,254
Don't you even think about it.

1040
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:20,932
I can't tell you how happy it makes me

1041
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:22,934
to see you all like this.

1042
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:27,731
You look awful.

1043
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:38,325
Jack. I'm scared.

1044
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:43,038
Jack. I'm scared.

1045
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:45,582
I know, I know.

1046
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:48,585
But you're gonna be all right.

1047
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:53,298
We're gonna have a little fun instead.

1048
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:56,801
That's it! That's my center!

1049
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,057
So what do you think, Jamie?

1050
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:07,145
Do you believe in the Boogey...

1051
01:16:13,653 --> 01:16:15,153
Now let's go get your friends.

1052
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:30,835
Cool!

1053
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:57,320
Jamie, how are you doing that?

1054
01:16:57,488 --> 01:17:00,073
Jack Frost!
Come on, we need your help!

1055
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:04,202
Hey, is that...

1056
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:05,954
Jack Frost!

1057
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:13,461
- Merry Christmas!
- Happy Easter!

1058
01:17:13,546 --> 01:17:14,921
Don't forget to floss!

1059
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:18,633
- Cupcake?
- What?

1060
01:17:21,262 --> 01:17:22,554
Jamie, you were right!

1061
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:24,472
The Easter Bunny's real!

1062
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:26,141
- The Tooth Fairy!
- And Santa!

1063
01:17:26,225 --> 01:17:27,559
They're all real!

1064
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:39,321
Yeah!

1065
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:45,160
You think a few children can help you?
Against this?

1066
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:55,003
They're just bad dreams, Jamie.

1067
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:58,173
And we'll protect you, mate.

1068
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:00,508
You'll protect them?

1069
01:18:02,762 --> 01:18:04,262
But who will protect you?

1070
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:15,982
I will.

1071
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:19,277
- I will.
- I will.

1072
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:21,946
And me.

1073
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:23,698
I'll try.

1074
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:32,123
Still think there's no such thing
as the Boogeyman?

1075
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:43,802
I do believe in you.
I'm just not afraid of you.

1076
01:19:04,824 --> 01:19:06,533
Yeah, Tooth Fairy!

1077
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:12,163
Yeah!

1078
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:14,165
No! Get them!

1079
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:16,334
Do your jobs!

1080
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:18,336
Yeah, come on, come on.

1081
01:19:18,421 --> 01:19:19,462
Oh, crikey!

1082
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:26,386
No way!

1083
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:31,057
I'm just a bunny!

1084
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:35,186
G'day, mate.

1085
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:46,489
Come on!

1086
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:52,203
Let's get them!

1087
01:19:54,415 --> 01:19:56,541
Come on, guys, we can do it!

1088
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:08,803
It's all yours, mate.

1089
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:14,517
Thanks, Tooth.

1090
01:20:20,483 --> 01:20:21,608
Wrong roof.

1091
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:39,876
Look at that!

1092
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:41,628
I got it!

1093
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:44,756
I know what we have to do.
Guys, come on.

1094
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:46,674
It's over, Pitch.

1095
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:48,718
There's no place to hide.

1096
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:58,853
Jack, look out!

1097
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:19,499
The Sandman!

1098
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:31,219
Mate, you are a sight for sore eyes.

1099
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:57,537
Pretty!

1100
01:22:47,046 --> 01:22:48,713
Your center?

1101
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:52,050
It took a while,

1102
01:22:52,676 --> 01:22:53,843
but I figured it out.

1103
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:08,399
You're all on naughty list!

1104
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:09,859
Bunny, think fast!

1105
01:23:15,449 --> 01:23:16,574
No.

1106
01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:24,040
You dare have fun in my presence?

1107
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:29,170
I am the Boogeyman
and you will fear me!

1108
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:32,757
No! No.

1109
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:48,022
Leaving the party so soon?

1110
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:50,566
You didn't even say goodbye.

1111
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,194
A quarter?

1112
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:00,785
And that's for my fairies.

1113
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:04,664
You can't get rid of me! Not forever.

1114
01:24:04,748 --> 01:24:06,916
There will always be fear.

1115
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:11,504
So what? As long as one child believes,

1116
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:14,465
we will be here to fight fear.

1117
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:18,553
Really? Then what are they doing here?

1118
01:24:22,683 --> 01:24:24,976
They can't be my Nightmares.
I'm not afraid.

1119
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:30,606
Looks like it's your fear they smell.

1120
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:45,830
No, no, no. No!

1121
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:49,208
No!

1122
01:25:07,311 --> 01:25:10,688
Are you ready now, Jack?
To make it official.

1123
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:17,653
Then is time you take Oath.

1124
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:23,367
Will you, Jack Frost,

1125
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:27,538
vow to watch over
the children of the world,

1126
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,457
to guard them with your life,

1127
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:32,460
their hopes, their wishes,
and their dreams,

1128
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:36,631
for they are all that we have,
all that we are,

1129
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:39,383
and all that we will ever be?

1130
01:25:44,223 --> 01:25:45,556
I will.

1131
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:50,353
Then, congratulations,
Jack Frost, for you are now,

1132
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:52,605
and forevermore,

1133
01:25:52,689 --> 01:25:54,023
a Guardian.

1134
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:04,659
That's my boy.

1135
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,666
Keep it together, girls.

1136
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:17,839
You guys, look!

1137
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:20,716
- That's Santa's sleigh.
- It's real!

1138
01:26:22,261 --> 01:26:23,761
You guys see that?

1139
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:28,182
Everyone loves the sleigh.

1140
01:26:28,267 --> 01:26:30,017
Look at that!

1141
01:26:30,644 --> 01:26:32,144
Time to go.

1142
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:42,238
It's beautiful.

1143
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:47,326
Happy Easter, you little ankle-biter.

1144
01:26:47,411 --> 01:26:48,619
I'm gonna miss you.

1145
01:26:49,329 --> 01:26:50,663
Bye-bye, Bunny.

1146
01:26:52,291 --> 01:26:53,374
You're leaving?

1147
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:55,251
But what if Pitch comes back?

1148
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:58,713
What if we stop believing again?
If I can't see you...

1149
01:26:58,797 --> 01:27:01,591
Hey, slow down, slow down.

1150
01:27:01,675 --> 01:27:04,302
You're telling me you stop believing in
the moon when the sun comes up?

1151
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:05,511
No.

1152
01:27:05,596 --> 01:27:07,722
Okay. Well, do you stop
believing in the sun

1153
01:27:07,806 --> 01:27:09,307
when clouds block it out?

1154
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:10,808
No.

1155
01:27:11,393 --> 01:27:15,146
We'll always be there, Jamie. And now,

1156
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:17,648
we'll always be here.

1157
01:27:18,775 --> 01:27:22,445
Which kind of makes you
a Guardian, too.

1158
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:29,827
Jack!

1159
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:58,439
My name is Jack Frost.

1160
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:00,274
And I'm a Guardian.

1161
01:28:00,359 --> 01:28:02,026
How do I know that?

1162
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:04,362
Because the moon told me so.

1163
01:28:05,364 --> 01:28:07,949
So when the moon tells you something,

1164
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:10,701
believe it.
