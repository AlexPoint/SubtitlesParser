1
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,350
In Virginia,

2
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,644
high school football
is a way of life.

3
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,771
It's bigger
than Christmas day.

4
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,107
My daddy
coached in Alexandria.

5
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,651
He worked so hard,
my mama left him,

6
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,111
but I stayed with Coach.

7
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,405
He needed me on that field.

8
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,826
Up until 1971
in Alexandria,

9
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,995
there was no race mixing.

10
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,080
Then the school board
forced us to integrate.

11
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,958
They combined the white school
and the black school into one

12
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,836
called
T. C. Williams High School.

13
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:38,849
Murderer ! Murderer !

14
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:40,559
hat summer
a black teenager was killed

15
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,561
by a white store owner,

16
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:45,105
and the city was
on the verge of exploding.

17
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:49,443
!! Well, my mind
is goin' through some changes !!

18
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,111
You've caused
enough damage !

19
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,738
- This is my store !
- Back off.

20
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,699
Blue left !
Blue left ! Left !

21
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,453
Come on, Kurt, don't let Ray
back you down like that !

22
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,413
You're twice his size !

23
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,749
Aargh !
What are they doing ?

24
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,043
If they keep playing like that,
we'll lose every game !

25
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,753
I didn't think
that was so bad.

26
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,338
!! She had to run !!

27
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,009
Looks good, Gerry.
I can see you been working.

28
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,761
Thanks.
Thanks a lot, Coach.

29
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,597
Listen, with the schools
integrating and all,

30
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:19,890
some of the guys are
worried about losing

31
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,308
their starting
positions.

32
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,602
Well, that's something we're
just gonna have to figure out,

33
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,187
but you don't worry
about that now.

34
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:27,648
You just keep at it.
All right ?

35
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:28,941
Yes, Coach.

36
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:32,194
Hey, guys ! Guys !

37
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,904
It's comin' down !

38
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:36,031
It's comin' down
at the store !

39
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,074
They want to burn
the place up

40
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,909
cause that colored kid
got shot.

41
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:40,494
Come on, man,
let's go.

42
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,581
Hey. Hey !

43
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,042
Coach ?

44
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,087
You just get Sheryl
to the school now, Herb.

45
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,505
!! Sorry !!

46
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,099
Get in the truck.

47
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,810
Gerry, Alan, Ray,

48
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,937
if you ever want
to play for me again,

49
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,064
get in the truck now.

50
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,067
You boys are gonna cool off,
come with me to my office,

51
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,569
help me finish
packing my things.

52
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,696
Gerry, son, your heart's
in the right place,

53
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,780
but you ought
to know better

54
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,115
than to embarrass
the coach like that.

55
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,992
Hell, why don't you just
kick them all off the team ?

56
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,827
I don't want to play with
any of those black animals.

57
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:22,828
Whoa.

58
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,413
I see him.

59
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,956
Who are you ?

60
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:28,208
I'm Herman Boone. I'm
the new assistant coach.

61
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,960
Well, from
the looks of things,

62
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:33,255
I'd say we got all the help
we need around here.

63
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,673
Why ain't you outside there

64
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,092
with all your
little friends, hollering' ?

65
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,557
This was the time that
was arranged for me

66
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,893
to meet with
Coach Yoast.

67
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,853
I never miss
an appointment.

68
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:51,148
Well, maybe you just
better reschedule.

69
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,983
Coach Boone, the school
board made the decision

70
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,736
to put you on my staff.
I did not hire you.

71
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,864
Well, I came up here
to coach at G.W.

72
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,158
I didn't ask the schools
to redistrict.

73
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,868
I didn't ask to be
assigned to your staff,

74
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,328
so I guess we're both
in a situation

75
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,412
we don't want to be in.

76
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,831
But I can guarantee
you this, Coach,

77
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,000
I come to win.

78
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:13,003
Win ? Coach Yoast
here has been nominated

79
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,422
to the Virginia
High School Hall of Fame.

80
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,758
15 winning seasons.

81
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:20,469
I won a couple of titles
down in North Carolina.

82
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,012
That's double ''A'' ball.

83
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:24,848
This here's Virginia.
We play triple ''A.''

84
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,143
What an opportunity
for me then  ...

85
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:32,356
to learn  ...
from the best.

86
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,485
!! Ooh, I bet
you're wonderin' how I knew !!

87
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,445
Are those
people the movers ?

88
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,906
No. Looks like
they're moving in here.

89
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,075
How many
of them are there ?

90
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,660
It only takes one.

91
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,078
Then we're gonna be
overrun by 'em.

92
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,081
Mommy, where are you
taking my teddybear ?

93
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:52,376
That. Come on, y'all.
Ohh.

94
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,461
Where is everybody ?

95
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,380
Nicky, yes.

96
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,091
Look there, here
comes some more of'em.

97
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,344
That's Dr. Day, that
Negro from the school board.

98
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,179
What's he doing here ?

99
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,473
The school board has decided
that Negro Herman Boone

100
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:07,766
is gonna be
the head coach at T.C.

101
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,352
It's not fair !
My daddy's head coach !

102
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,229
This is gonna be
his Hall of Fame year !

103
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:13,689
No one
is trying to takeaway

104
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,649
your daddy's future
place in the hall.

105
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,527
You can't just walk in here
and take my daddy's job away !

106
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,780
That is enough, Sheryl.
That's enough.

107
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:26,660
Sheryl !

108
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,120
Ow.

109
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,580
I  ...

110
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,375
it's all right, Bill.
I feel the same way.

111
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,669
It's those agitators
and race-mixers

112
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,588
I feel like
taking a swat at.

113
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,131
Troublemakers in
the Berg are ready

114
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,257
to put a torch
to the city.

115
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,258
to put a torch
to the city.

116
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,969
You want us to burn up
like Watts ?

117
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,554
Every head coach in
the system is white.

118
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,431
We had to give them
something.

119
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:51,143
It's the world we live in,
God help us all.

120
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:54,271
I left North Carolina
because I was passed over

121
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,273
for a job that I had
rightfully earned.

122
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,150
Gave it to a white coach
down there

123
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,027
couldn't even tie up
his own football cleats.

124
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,570
Now you are asking me

125
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,697
to do the same thing
to this man ?

126
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:04,990
I can't do that.

127
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,242
Herman ?

128
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:11,997
Folks in Carolina say
you marched with Dr. King.

129
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,459
Say you stood toe-to-toe
with the Klan.

130
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,877
Said you're a race man.

131
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,879
That's right.
I'm also a family man.

132
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,715
Coach Boone, black folks
have never had

133
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,634
anything in this city
to call their own

134
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,844
except humiliation
and despair.

135
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,304
Dr. Day, excuse me.

136
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,473
Herman, I think you'd
better look outside.

137
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,951
So, you see,
we need you, Coach Boone.

138
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,036
Come on,
meet the people.

139
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,038
Coach Boone,
I'm Charles Campbell.

140
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,499
This here is
my boy Julius.

141
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,084
He can be the fi nest
defensive end

142
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,503
in the whole state
if you push him to it.

143
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:00,796
I've heard a lot
about you.

144
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,381
You're like an answer
to our prayers.

145
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:04,341
Now, wait a minute. I'm not
an answer to your prayers.

146
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:08,345
I'm not a savior
or Jesus Christ,

147
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,055
Martin Luther King,
or the Easter bunny.

148
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,099
I'm a football coach,
that's all.

149
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,475
Just a football coach.

150
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:14,643
You're our coach.

151
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:16,186
You're our coach !

152
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,813
Coach Boone !

153
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:27,239
Boone ! Boone ! Boone !

154
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,542
What do you want ?

155
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,962
Is Coach Yoast here ?

156
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,005
We're busy  ...

157
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,674
interviewing
for head coaching jobs.

158
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,386
Gotten 11 offers and
certainly no time for you.

159
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,399
Well, come on in.
I've got an office out back.

160
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:06,862
Look, I can't
even spell diplomacy,

161
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:09,156
and I'm sorry about
the way things went down,

162
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,159
but make no mistake,
I am qualified

163
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,243
to be this school's
head coach.

164
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,703
Sure. You've been in,
what,

165
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,705
4 or 5 programs
in the past 1 0 years ?

166
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,290
With 4 or5
championships.

167
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,708
This isn't about me.

168
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,044
I'm worried about my boys.

169
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,172
Well, I ain't gonna
cook 'em and eat 'em.

170
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,883
The best player will play.
Color won't matter.

171
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:30,469
From the looks of our
little situation we got here,

172
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,471
I'd say it's about
all that does.

173
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,181
Yeah, you're right.

174
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,599
We're in
a tough spot, Coach,

175
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,309
you, me, the whole city.

176
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,603
I think it would go a long
way to smooth things over

177
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,897
if you would stay,
work on the staff,

178
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:44,608
be a defensive coordinator,
assistant head coach.

179
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:47,569
Work under you ?

180
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,447
If that's the way
you see it.

181
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,577
Good night, Coach.

182
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,625
It's been
a rare privilege

183
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,752
to have lived here
as long as I have

184
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:04,920
coaching your boys.

185
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,214
I'll be taking
the year off  ...

186
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,632
No.

187
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:11,927
after which
I'll be moving to Loudon

188
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:15,222
and taking the head coaching
job at Loudon High.

189
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:19,226
- I say boycott T.C. Williams !
- Tell 'em, Fred !

190
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,645
Our boys aren't playing
for some ''Coach Coon ! ''

191
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,772
Coach,
he stole your job.

192
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,524
I'm not playing for him.

193
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,818
I started a petition, and I'm
sitting this season out.

194
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,278
Only place
you're going to sit

195
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,904
is back in that chair,
Gerry.

196
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,364
I appreciate it, though.

197
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,950
Boycott T. C. !
Boycott the school !

198
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,661
Stop this, Fred.
You know none of these boys

199
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,663
can afford to go
to some other district

200
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:40,706
just to play ball.

201
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,291
They sit this one out,

202
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:43,876
they put their futures
on the line.

203
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,961
Coach, I'm out, too.

204
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,212
I'm not playing
for no thief.

205
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,672
Don't do this.

206
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,966
Don't make this any harder
for me than it already is.

207
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,718
Coach, if you go, I go.

208
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:54,845
only play
for you, Coach Yoast.

209
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,389
Don't go, Coach.
You can't leave us.

210
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:00,392
Coach Yoast !
Coach Yoast ! Coach Yoast !

211
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,442
We'll be all right,
Coach.

212
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:10,986
I've coached
most of these boys

213
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:12,321
since they
were your age.

214
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,906
I've seen them grow up
in front of my eyes,

215
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,408
almost like
they were my own kids.

216
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,618
Almost.

217
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,871
This is a heck of a time
to be abandoning them

218
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,290
to look out for
themselves, ain't it ?

219
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,585
So...what are you
gonna do ?

220
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,048
We gonna play
some ball, y'all !

221
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:33,592
Black inside, black inside,
black inside.

222
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,177
Unh, unh, unh, unh !

223
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,221
Yo, Petey,
how many yards you figure

224
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,639
you gonna get
this season, bro ?

225
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,724
You know, I ain't one
to brag, big Blue,

226
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:42,768
but I figure on
at least a thousand.

227
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,770
But I ain't
one to brag.

228
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,313
Didn't I tell you
all them white boys

229
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:47,606
weren't gonna play
for no brother ?

230
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,149
Well, who needs 'em, baby ?

231
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:52,611
From now on the Titans gonna be
powered by soul power, bro.

232
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:56,782
! He said soul power !

233
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,159
Shut up.

234
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,382
Put your hand down.

235
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,383
You're smiling.

236
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,384
Yes.

237
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,761
Yes, sir.
Why are you smiling ?

238
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:20,806
Cause I love football.
Football's fun.

239
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,891
Fun, sir. It's fun ?

240
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:23,892
- Yes.
- You sure ?

241
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:24,893
I think  ...

242
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:25,936
Now you're thinking'.

243
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,563
First you smile,
then you thinking'.

244
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,231
You think football
is still fun ?

245
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,274
Uh, yes.

246
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,275
Sir.

247
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,235
- Yes--no, sir.
- No ?

248
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:34,778
It was fun.

249
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,363
Not anymore, though,
is it ?

250
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:37,406
Not right now.

251
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,241
It's not fun anymore.
Not even a little bit.

252
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:40,826
Uh...no.

253
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,661
Make up your mind.
Think since you're thinking.

254
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,371
Go on, think.
Is it fun ?

255
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:45,539
- No, sir.
- No ?

256
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:46,540
Absolutely not ?

257
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:47,666
Zero fun, sir.

258
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,668
All right, listen up.
I'm Coach Boone.

259
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,797
I'm gonna tell you all
about how much ''fun''

260
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,008
you're gonna have
this season.

261
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:59,219
We leave for camp,
Gettysburg College,

262
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:02,139
August 1 5th, 7:29 A.M.

263
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,974
If you report at 7::30,

264
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,726
you will not be playing
football this season,

265
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,269
you will be watching.

266
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,855
You will wear
a jacket, shirt, and tie.

267
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,315
If you don't have one,
buy one.

268
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,734
Can't afford one,
borrow one from your old man.

269
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,819
If you don't
have an old man,

270
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:18,697
then find a drunk,
trade him for his.

271
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,574
Cause I guarantee you
there isn't a bum on the street

272
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,117
that looks as raggedy
and ridiculous

273
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,577
as what I'm looking at
right now.

274
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,621
This is no democracy.

275
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:28,624
It is a dictatorship.

276
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,168
I am the law.

277
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:35,881
If you survive camp,
you will be on the team.

278
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:39,301
If you survive.

279
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:40,552
Check 'em in, Coach.

280
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,179
Checkin' 'em in.

281
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:44,640
I'm Coach Hinds,
your offensive line coach.

282
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,017
Yell out your name and position
starting from the right.

283
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:48,769
Petey Jones,
running back.

284
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,562
The running back, y'all.

285
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:51,647
Whatever, Petey.

286
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,148
Get out here !

287
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jerry Harris, quarterback.

288
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:59,905
Hallelujah !
Hallelujah, Rev !

289
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:00,864
Rev ?

290
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,908
It's just
a nickname.

291
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:05,911
And who in the name
of heaven might you be ?

292
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:09,665
Louie Lastik,
offensive lineman.

293
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,084
Naval family, just moved
here from Bayonne.

294
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,961
Someone said football,
so I come runnin'.

295
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:15,254
What's goin' on,
everybody ?

296
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,226
With him calling the shots,
ain't none of us

297
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,520
gonna see nothin'
but the bench this year.

298
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:34,064
He ain't calling
the shots. You'll play.

299
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,699
You have just disrupted

300
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,242
my first team meeting

301
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,910
in an unacceptable
fashion.

302
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,370
This is my team now.

303
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:49,788
Either you're with that
or you're not.

304
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,832
I'm here, ain't I ?
Let's talk football.

305
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:52,958
Let's talk football.

306
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,585
I run the defense  ...

307
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:57,838
As a part of
my team strategy.

308
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,840
Now, I have never seen
an assistant coach's name

309
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:01,675
in the newspaper
for losing a game.

310
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:03,135
I want a job
for Coach Tyrell.

311
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,678
He's been with me
for 1 0 years.

312
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,513
I won't leave him
out in the cold.

313
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,223
You don't get me
without him.

314
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:10,809
You're overcooking
my grits, Coach.

315
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:16,690
All right. I will
allow Coach Tyrell

316
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:18,150
to coach
the special team,

317
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,235
but I will have
my eye on him.

318
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:22,696
And you.

319
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:29,912
Good morning, good morning,
Coaches, how are you ?

320
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:31,288
Good morning
to you.

321
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:33,290
Looks good today,
doesn't it ?

322
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,751
Just wanted to let you know
what the offense is doing.

323
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,586
Awful skinny play book,
ain't it ?

324
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:41,715
I run 6 plays, split veer.
It's like novocaine.

325
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:43,467
Just give it time,
always works.

326
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:44,551
See you on the bus.

327
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,930
Be patient, Bill.
Your time will come.

328
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:49,932
Herman, here we go.

329
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,600
Here we go.

330
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,188
How can I help
you boys ?

331
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,648
I'm Gerry Bertier,

332
00:14:57,773 --> 00:15:00,484
the only all-American
you got on this team.

333
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:02,778
You want any of us
to play for you,

334
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,238
you reserve half
the open positions

335
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,572
for Hammond players,

336
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,491
half the offense,
half the special teams.

337
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,493
We don't need any of
your people on defense.

338
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:10,619
We're already set.

339
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,955
Uh-huh. Don't need
none of my people ?

340
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,040
What did you say
your name was, Jerry ?

341
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,375
Gerry.

342
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,335
No, you must have said
Jerry, like Lewis,

343
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:22,089
which would make you
Dean Martin, right ?

344
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:24,967
Ladies and gentlemen,
I got an announcement to make.

345
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,970
We got Jerry Lewis
and Dean Martin

346
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,888
going to camp with us
here this year.

347
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,557
Jerry tells the jokes,

348
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,351
Dean sings the songs
and gets the girl.

349
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,520
Let's give them
a round of applause.

350
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,821
Where's your folks,
Gerry ?

351
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,656
Your parents,
are they here ?

352
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:49,950
Where are they ?

353
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:51,368
That's my mother.

354
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,661
That's your mama ?

355
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:54,538
Very nice.
How are you ?

356
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:57,082
Take a good look at her.

357
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,542
Cause once
you get on that bus,

358
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,086
you ain't got no mama
no more.

359
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,547
You got your brothers
on the team,

360
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,090
and you got your daddy.

361
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,842
Now, you know who
your daddy is, don't you ?

362
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:10,429
Gerry, if you want to play
on this football team,

363
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:15,601
you answer me when I ask you
who is your daddy.

364
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:18,270
Who's your daddy, Gerry ?

365
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:19,605
Who's your daddy ?

366
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:23,233
You.

367
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:25,694
Uh-huh. And whose team
is this ?

368
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:30,157
Is this your team,
or is this your daddy's team ?

369
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:31,700
Yours.

370
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:35,120
Mm-hmm. Get on the bus.

371
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:39,208
Put your jacket on first
and get on the bus.

372
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,209
OK.

373
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:44,338
Uh, Dean ?

374
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,883
Fix that tie, son.

375
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:03,315
All right, listen up,
I want everybody off the bus.

376
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,776
Let's go. Follow me. Everybody.
Let's go right now.

377
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:07,027
Why we got
to get off the bus ?

378
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,654
hat are
they doing, man ?

379
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:12,032
All right,
everybody, off the bus.

380
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,492
Listen up, I don't care

381
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:15,744
if you're black, green,
blue, white, or orange,

382
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:18,372
I want all of my defensive
players on this side,

383
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:20,874
all players going out
for offense over here.

384
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,042
Right now.

385
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,503
Let's move ! Let's move !
Let's move ! Let's move !

386
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,798
You and you, offensive bus.
Sit together.

387
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:30,634
You and you, defensive bus.
Sit together.

388
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,177
Get comfortable, too,

389
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,638
because the person that
I have you sitting next to

390
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:37,349
is the same one
you'll be rooming with

391
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,476
for the duration
of this camp.

392
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,524
! 'Cause, baby !

393
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:50,112
! There ain't
no mountain high enough !

394
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:53,782
! Ain't no valley
low enough !

395
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:56,285
Blue, shut up.

396
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:58,120
I don't want to see
your smilin' and shuff in',

397
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:01,123
and hear all your minstrel
show singing on this bus.

398
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:03,208
You, too.

399
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:05,252
Got that right.

400
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,131
You can shut up, too.

401
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,984
!! When I die
and they lay me to rest !!

402
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,694
That's my bed.

403
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,989
!! Gonna go to the place
that's the best !!

404
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:36,700
!! When I lay me
down to die !!

405
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,160
And that's his bed.

406
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:41,455
!! Up to the spirit
in the sky !!

407
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,999
!! Goin' up to the spirit
in the sky !!

408
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,709
I ain't lookin' at that
for 2 weeks, man.

409
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,127
Take it down.

410
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:48,420
!! When I die !!

411
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:51,423
You can close your eyes
for 2 weeks, all I care.

412
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:53,342
Why don't you look at your wall
and I'll look at mine ?

413
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:54,885
I'll look
wherever I want to,

414
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,179
and I don't want to be
looking at that for 2 weeks.

415
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,890
Then you better use your
X-ray vision, Superman,

416
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:02,351
and look right through it,
cause it ain't comin' down.

417
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:10,442
Aah !

418
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:13,237
Fight !

419
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,072
Fight ?

420
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:16,490
Fight !

421
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:17,491
Follow me !

422
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:18,659
Come on ! Come on !

423
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:19,910
All right,
wait up !

424
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,246
Get off me !
Get off me !

425
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,331
Get him off.

426
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:25,541
Get off me !

427
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:27,960
Bunch of tough guys, huh ?

428
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:32,506
You look like a bunch
of fifth-grade sissies

429
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,633
after a cat fight.

430
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,635
You got anger. That's good.

431
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,512
You're gonna need it, son.

432
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:40,055
You got aggression.
That's even better.

433
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:41,348
You're gonna
need that, too,

434
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:44,810
butany2-year-oldchild
can throw a fit.

435
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:48,564
Foot ball is about
controlling that anger.

436
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:51,650
Harnessing that aggression
into a team effort

437
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,986
to achieve perfection !

438
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:56,530
Some coaches,
they cut a player

439
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:59,408
if they think
he's not up to snuff.

440
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,952
When they think
he's hurting the team.

441
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:03,954
This is
a public school program.

442
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:06,290
I will never, ever
cut a player

443
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,875
who comes out
to play for me,

444
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,294
but when you put
that uniform on,

445
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:13,255
that Titan uniform,
you better come to work.

446
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,135
We will be perfect  ...

447
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,678
in every aspect of the game.

448
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:21,805
You drop a pass,
you run a mile.

449
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:24,141
You miss a blocking assignment,
you run a mile.

450
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,851
You fumble the football,

451
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:30,731
and I will break my foot off
in your John Brown hind parts  ...

452
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:32,316
and then you will run a mile.

453
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:34,026
Perfection !

454
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,447
Let's go to work.

455
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:42,743
Move !
Move those feet !

456
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:43,994
Get up, boy ! Get up ! Get up !

457
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:46,288
Get up ! Get up ! Get up !

458
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:49,541
Keep those heads up !

459
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,710
Keep those feet moving !

460
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:53,170
Everything
we gonna do is changing.

461
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:55,005
We are change.

462
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:56,757
We're gonna change
the way we run.

463
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,176
We're gonna change
the way we eat.

464
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:00,594
We're gonna change
the way we block.

465
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:03,013
We're gonna change
the way we tackle.

466
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:04,640
We're gonna change
the way we win.

467
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:06,892
Defense is desire !

468
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:07,935
Fire and desire.

469
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:09,728
Defense ! Come on !

470
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:15,651
Get up. Get outta here.
Go run. Go.

471
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:22,032
Unh !

472
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:23,867
Keep those legs movin' !
Keep those legs apart !

473
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:25,369
Keep movin: keep movin'.

474
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:27,329
Keep that ball with you till
you get outta the briar patch.

475
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:29,790
Show me, son ! Show me, 'Bama !

476
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:31,041
Show me, 'Bama !

477
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,043
Jump on that ball carrier
like a starving man

478
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:34,670
on a Christmas ham.

479
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:37,047
Hut !

480
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:40,926
Fumble ! Fumble !

481
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,344
What is wrong with you ?

482
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:43,554
Why are you fumbling
my football ?

483
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:44,888
My blockers were bad.

484
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,889
Your blockers
ain't got nothin'

485
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,558
to do with you
holding the ball !

486
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:49,101
Did your blockers
fumble the football,

487
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,686
or did you fumble
the football ?

488
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:51,770
I did, sir.

489
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:53,230
All right. How many
feet are in a mile ?

490
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:55,107
How many feet
are in a mile ?

491
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,359
5,280 feet !

492
00:21:57,401 --> 00:22:01,530
You pick this ball up,
you run every one of them !

493
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:04,867
You're killing me, Petey !
You're killing me !

494
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:16,837
What you doing, man ?

495
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:19,840
Eating lunch.

496
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:21,800
I see you eating lunch.

497
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:23,802
But why you
eating over here ?

498
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:26,305
Why don't you go on over there
and eat with your people ?

499
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,807
Man, I don't have
any people.

500
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:30,267
I'm with everybody,
Julius.

501
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:32,227
He's just
alight-skinned brother.

502
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:34,855
Yeah, and I'm
a dark-skinned cracker.

503
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,858
Come on, Julius, he's
just another blessed child

504
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:40,277
in God's loving family.

505
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,448
Come on, Blue, let me  ...

506
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:51,163
Lord, we come
before you today  ...

507
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:55,167
and ask you to soften
big Julius Campbell's heart.

508
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:58,462
Look at that traitor.

509
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:00,297
And Rev ?
He better be praying

510
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:03,175
I block for
his black behind.

511
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,177
Yeah, but, Ray,
if you don't block

512
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:06,845
you're not gonna start.

513
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:09,181
I'll start.

514
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:10,599
I'll just bide
my time.

515
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:13,477
I got some plays we won
the city title with last year.

516
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:16,772
Got some trick plays,
some stuff that might

517
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:19,900
fi re up the boys'
imaginations a little bit.

518
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,860
Trick plays ?

519
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:23,737
I think unless the boys
start having a little fun

520
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:25,781
they're not gonna put points
up on that board for you.

521
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:27,324
You worry
about your defense.

522
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:28,534
Let me worry about
the offense.

523
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:32,079
All right.

524
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:33,956
Lastik !

525
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:42,965
I want you to
tell me something

526
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:44,508
about one of your
black teammates.

527
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:45,801
Sir, yes, sir !

528
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:47,261
I'm rooming with Blue, sir,

529
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:50,180
and I noticed he wears those
leopard-spotted under wears,

530
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:51,765
bikini-style, sir !

531
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:54,685
OK, maybe somebody
who's not your roommate.

532
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,645
Sir, I eat lunch with Rev.

533
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:58,522
That's Jerry Harris, sir !

534
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:00,524
People call him Rev
cause he's always praying,

535
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:03,819
and he won't abide
a foul tongue, sir !

536
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:05,696
And what is the Rev gonna
do after high school ?

537
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:07,239
I don't know.

538
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:09,533
Go to college
and all that, I guess.

539
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:11,118
What about you ?
You gonna go to college ?

540
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:12,661
Oh, not me, Coach.

541
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:14,204
I ain't a brainiac
like Rev.

542
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:15,789
Think you got a future
in football ?

543
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:18,834
Heck, no. I just figure
if I got to be in school

544
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,836
I might as well hit some
people while I'm at it.

545
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:22,671
All right, I like that.

546
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:24,381
A self-aware man,
I like that.

547
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:26,675
But if you don't
go to college,

548
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:28,802
it's not gonna be because
you're not qualified,

549
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:30,721
so I want you to bring me
your test scores

550
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:33,140
at the end of every week, and
we'll go over them together, OK ?

551
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:35,100
We'll keep that
between you and me.

552
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:36,268
OK.

553
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:40,022
So, what kind of music
does the Rev like ?

554
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:41,690
Me and Rev both
dig on The Temptations.

555
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:42,816
Oh, yeah ?

556
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:44,902
! I know you want
to leave me !

557
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:48,989
! But I refuse
to let you go !

558
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:50,991
!! If I got to pray !!

559
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:53,118
!! Plead for your sympathy !!

560
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,828
! I don't mind !

561
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,872
! 'Cause you mean
that much to me !

562
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:59,166
! Ain't too proud
to beg !

563
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,168
OK, all right.
Stop begging.

564
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:03,545
Anybody else ?

565
00:25:06,215 --> 00:25:08,175
No volunteers ?

566
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:12,012
Campbell ?

567
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,892
Bertier ?

568
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:20,479
No, huh ?

569
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:28,195
Each one of you
will spend time every day

570
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,948
with a teammate of
a different race.

571
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:33,617
You will learn
about him and his family,

572
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,202
his likes, his dislikes.

573
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:38,080
You will report back to me

574
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:40,916
until you meet every one
of your teammates.

575
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:44,628
Until that time,
we go to 3-a-day practices.

576
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:47,089
You continue
to ignore each other,

577
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:49,508
we'll go
to 4-a-daypractices.

578
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,802
Now, is there any part of this
you don't understand ?

579
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,930
Let's see.
What's your daddy's name ?

580
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:56,932
I mean, you do have
a daddy right ?

581
00:25:56,974 --> 00:26:00,102
I have a father,
and his name is Eric.

582
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:02,062
And what's he do ?

583
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:04,273
Wait, he does have
a job, right ?

584
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:08,986
!! They're gonna

585
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:13,407
Huh ? Yes ! This one.

586
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:15,826
I don't even have
to ask, but I will.

587
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:17,286
What do you think
of this one ?

588
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:20,289
Does the term ''cruel
and unusual punishment''

589
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:22,082
mean anything to you ?

590
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,960
2 minutes to go
in the game.

591
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:26,670
The other team is out there,
they're tired.

592
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:28,380
Fourth quarter.
Fourth quarter.

593
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:30,257
Fourth quarter.

594
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:32,843
Nobody from my family
ever went to no college.

595
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:33,886
I'll tutor you,
Louie.

596
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:35,429
I'm white trash !

597
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:37,264
I ain't gonna get
no C-plus grades !

598
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:39,308
I'm just down-home, no-good,

599
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:42,311
never-goin'-to-no-college
white trash, man !

600
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:43,854
Would you hurry up
and get off the phone ?

601
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:45,105
I got to call
my girl, too, man !

602
00:26:45,147 --> 00:26:46,440
Say it right now.

603
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:50,235
Oh, oh, don't
do this right now.

604
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:52,446
Hey, man, what is this,
Wild Kingdom ?

605
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:53,572
Shut up, y'all !

606
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:55,282
Mating habits of
the mountain gorillas ?

607
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:57,451
Gerry, you say it, or I'm
not hanging up the phone.

608
00:26:57,534 --> 00:27:00,746
Say it right now.

609
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:02,164
I love you, sugar.

610
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:04,750
Ha ha ha !
'I love you, sugar ! ''

611
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:05,876
Left !

612
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,419
Let's go !

613
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:08,712
Watch it !
Watch it !

614
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:10,756
Set ! Hut !

615
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,177
et him !
Get him ! Get him !

616
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,013
What are y' all doing ?

617
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:20,849
44 stack ! You're supposed
to know your jobs !

618
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:23,352
Campbell, you're playing
selfish, show-off football.

619
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:24,478
Hold your man down.

620
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:26,021
Don't you single me out
like that.

621
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:27,564
What, you think
I'm stupid or something ?

622
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:29,024
Listen,
I'm the team captain,

623
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:30,567
and I don't need you
up in my face  ...

624
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:33,612
We're here to
play football, y'all.

625
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:35,030
Let's play football.

626
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:37,074
Doc ?

627
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:38,492
I got it.

628
00:27:38,617 --> 00:27:40,244
Y'all didn't come
out here to practice !

629
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,621
Cause champions
pay the price !

630
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:45,040
Lookin' like a bunch
of bums out here !

631
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:48,335
Who's a coward ?
Cowards won't block.

632
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,504
Cowards won't tackle.

633
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:53,090
Cowards won't
go after fumbles.

634
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:54,633
Coach,
we need a water break.

635
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:55,634
We been out here all day.

636
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:58,762
What did you say ?

637
00:27:58,804 --> 00:28:00,389
I said we need
a water break.

638
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:02,391
You need a water break.

639
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:05,477
Water is for cowards.
Water makes you weak.

640
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:07,813
Water is for washing
blood off that uniform,

641
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:09,815
and you don't get
no blood on my uniform.

642
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,568
Boy, you must be
outside your mind !

643
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:15,112
We are going to do up-downs

644
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:18,866
until Blue is no longer
tired and thirsty.

645
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:31,128
Coach !

646
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,261
There's a fine line
between tough and crazy,

647
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:41,305
and you're firting
with it.

648
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:50,147
All right,
get some water.

649
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:54,818
I'll take that.

650
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,695
Hey, wait
your turn, boy.

651
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,988
Who you calling
a boy, cracker ?

652
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,824
Yaah !

653
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:03,160
Quit it, jerks !

654
00:29:03,202 --> 00:29:06,121
Come on ! You're all acting
like a bunch of sissies !

655
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:07,623
Quit it !

656
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:20,761
All right, man, listen.
I'm Gerry, you're Julius.

657
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:22,221
Let's get some particulars

658
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,764
and just get this
over with, all right ?

659
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:25,307
- Particulars ?
- Yeah.

660
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:26,475
No matter what I tell you,

661
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:28,018
you ain't never gonna know
nothing about me.

662
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:31,188
Listen, I ain't runnin'
any more of these 3-a-days.

663
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,856
What I got to say,
you really don't want to hear

664
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:36,235
cause honesty ain't too high
on your people's priority list.

665
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:38,195
Honesty ?
You want honesty ?

666
00:29:38,237 --> 00:29:41,365
All right, honestly,
I think you're nothing.

667
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,866
Nothing
but a pure waste

668
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:44,618
of God-given talent.

669
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:46,620
You don't listen
to nobody, man.

670
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:48,664
Not even Doc or Boone !

671
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:50,624
Shiver push on the line
every time, man.

672
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:52,960
You blow right past 'em !

673
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:56,505
Push 'em !
Pull 'em ! Do something !

674
00:29:56,547 --> 00:29:58,507
You can't run over
everybody in this league,

675
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:01,051
and every time you do, you
leave one of your teammates

676
00:30:01,093 --> 00:30:02,970
hanging out to dry  ...
me in particular !

677
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:06,223
Why should I give a hoot
about you, huh ?

678
00:30:06,223 --> 00:30:08,100
Or anybody else out there ?

679
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:09,893
You want to talk about a waste,
you the captain ?

680
00:30:09,935 --> 00:30:10,978
Right.

681
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:12,980
- Captain's supposed to be
the leader, right ?

682
00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:14,773
You got a job ? You
been doing your job ?

683
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:16,108
I've been doing my job.

684
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:18,193
Then why don't you tell
your white buddies

685
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:20,112
to block for Rev better ?
Cause they have not blocked

686
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:22,406
for him worth a plugged nickel,
and you know it !

687
00:30:22,531 --> 00:30:26,702
Nobody plays !
Your self included !

688
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:29,538
I'm supposed to wear
my self out for the team ?

689
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,832
What team ?!

690
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:34,585
No. No, what
I'm gonna do is,

691
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:36,587
I'm gonna look out
for myself,

692
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,963
and I'm gonna get mine.

693
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:40,883
See, man ?

694
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:43,218
That's the worst attitude
I ever heard.

695
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:48,223
Attitude refects
leadership, Captain.

696
00:30:57,274 --> 00:31:01,737
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go !

697
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:03,822
Wake up, gentlemen,
it's late.

698
00:31:03,864 --> 00:31:06,158
It's 3A.M. In the morning.

699
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,202
All right, listen up.

700
00:31:08,285 --> 00:31:11,705
You will follow Doc, myself,
and the other coaches,

701
00:31:11,747 --> 00:31:13,749
we're gonna take a little
run through the woods.

702
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:16,001
If you get lost
along the way,

703
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:18,170
don't bother
coming back to camp.

704
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:20,297
Just hitchhike
your hind parts on home.

705
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:21,715
Any questions ?

706
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:23,592
Coach, this is a high
school football team.

707
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:27,012
We're not in
the marines here.

708
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:29,431
Let's go.

709
00:31:29,473 --> 00:31:30,432
Let's go.

710
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:39,900
!! Tell me,
where have you been !!

711
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:42,194
!! My blue-eyed son ?!!

712
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,239
!! Where have you been !!

713
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:48,075
!! My darlin' young one ?!!

714
00:31:49,618 --> 00:31:52,329
!! I've stumbled
up on the side !!

715
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:55,624
!! Of12mistymountains !!

716
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:57,876
!! I've walked
and I've crawled !!

717
00:31:57,918 --> 00:32:00,337
!! Over6brokenhighways !!

718
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:02,923
!! But it's hard !!

719
00:32:02,965 --> 00:32:05,801
!! It's hard !!

720
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:07,052
Oh, no, no.
Shoot !

721
00:32:07,094 --> 00:32:09,638
Come on, baby.
Can't take no rest.

722
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,515
!! Oh, it's hard, girl !!

723
00:32:11,557 --> 00:32:14,351
!! It's a hard rain !!

724
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:18,230
!! A-gonna fall !!

725
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:27,531
Any body know
what this place is ?

726
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:33,495
This is Gettysburg.

727
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:36,999
This is where they fought
the Battle of Gettysburg.

728
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:43,130
50,000 men died right here
on this field,

729
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:46,258
fightin' the same fight

730
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:49,011
that we're still fightin'
amongst ourselves  ...

731
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:52,139
today.

732
00:32:52,222 --> 00:32:54,141
This green field right here

733
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:55,851
was painted red.

734
00:32:55,976 --> 00:33:00,439
Bubbling with the blood
of young boys.

735
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:02,232
Smoke  ...

736
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:08,697
and hot lead pouring
right through their bodies.

737
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:13,118
Listen to their souls, men.

738
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,206
'I killed my brother
with malice in my heart. ''

739
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:23,462
' Hatred destroyed my family.''

740
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:26,298
You listen  ...

741
00:33:28,717 --> 00:33:31,303
and you take a lesson
from the dead.

742
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:36,892
If we don't come together  ...

743
00:33:36,934 --> 00:33:40,938
right now,
on this hallowed ground  ...

744
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:43,148
then we, too,
will be destroyed.

745
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:47,611
Just like they were.

746
00:33:48,904 --> 00:33:51,448
I don't care if you
like each other or not,

747
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,784
but you will
respect each other,

748
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:54,785
and maybe  ...

749
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:58,038
I don't know,
maybe we'll  ...

750
00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:02,960
learn to play this game
like men.

751
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:04,211
Hut !

752
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:08,924
Here we go !

753
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:11,385
All right.

754
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:15,097
We'll be out here all night,
until we get this thing right.

755
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:16,265
Let's go.

756
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:17,516
Let's go,
team, pick it up !

757
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:18,642
On the ball, Rev.

758
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:19,935
Come on, everybody.

759
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,270
Get it right !

760
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:23,355
Ready !

761
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,649
Set !

762
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:26,692
Whoo !

763
00:34:26,817 --> 00:34:27,818
Check blue !

764
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:29,236
There it is. Whoo !

765
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:30,487
Let's go ! Hut !

766
00:34:33,866 --> 00:34:35,784
Get him !
Get him ! Get him !

767
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:40,247
What was that, Ray ?

768
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:41,707
Whatever it is,
it ain't blockin' !

769
00:34:41,832 --> 00:34:42,791
Give me a break, Gerry.

770
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:44,126
You want a break ?
I'll give you a break !

771
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:45,502
Wait a minute,
wait, wait.

772
00:34:45,544 --> 00:34:46,545
Let them handle this.

773
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:48,130
If we get to Rev once,
just one time,

774
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:49,673
Is wear to God,
I'm gonna hit you so hard,

775
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:50,966
by the time you come to,

776
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,301
ooh, boy, you're gonna
need a new haircut.

777
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:54,720
You understand me ? Uhh !

778
00:34:54,845 --> 00:34:55,804
Ha ha ha ha !

779
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:57,389
Let's play, fellas !

780
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:01,435
On the ball.
Let's run it again.

781
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:05,981
Ready !

782
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:07,316
All right.

783
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:08,317
Muskrat !

784
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,986
Set ! Hut !

785
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:19,286
Get off me !

786
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:20,329
Hoo hoo !

787
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:21,705
You all right,
big Petey ?

788
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:22,706
You all right ?

789
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:24,333
You really stuck him,
Campbell.

790
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:26,335
Yeah, I love me
a little contact, Petey !

791
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:29,171
This is left side !

792
00:35:32,758 --> 00:35:34,718
- Strong side !
- Left side !

793
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,345
- Strong side !
- Left side !

794
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:37,554
Strong side !

795
00:35:37,596 --> 00:35:38,555
Left side !

796
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:40,182
- Strong side !
- Left side !

797
00:35:40,224 --> 00:35:41,183
Strong side !

798
00:35:41,225 --> 00:35:46,188
- Aah !
- Aah !

799
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:49,900
What wins games ?

800
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:51,026
Defense !

801
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:52,736
- What wins games ?
- Defense !

802
00:35:52,778 --> 00:35:56,073
- What wins games ?
- Defense !

803
00:35:59,785 --> 00:36:02,538
!! I was once out strolling !!

804
00:36:02,621 --> 00:36:06,750
!! One very hot
summer's day !!

805
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:10,671
!! When I thought I'd
lay myself down to rest !!

806
00:36:10,796 --> 00:36:12,047
Hey, fellas.

807
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:13,215
Look at that fruitcake.

808
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,051
Gerry, just keep
your mouth shut

809
00:36:16,093 --> 00:36:17,636
and get back
on that field.

810
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:19,346
Coach Boone,
I'm Colonel Bass.

811
00:36:19,388 --> 00:36:20,681
I just got transferred here

812
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:22,099
from Huntington Beach,
California.

813
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:23,934
This is my son Ronnie,
and he's a quarterback.

814
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:26,353
How you doing, Ronnie ?
This is Coach Yoast.

815
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:27,521
My pleasure.

816
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:29,565
We're pretty set at the,
uh, quarterback, Colonel,

817
00:36:29,648 --> 00:36:31,400
but, uh,
if the boy's any good,

818
00:36:31,483 --> 00:36:33,944
you may want to check out
Wilson or Hamilton.

819
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:36,113
Well, I, uh,
I met Coach Taber.

820
00:36:36,113 --> 00:36:37,948
He won't let
blacks play on his team.

821
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:39,241
The way I see it,

822
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:41,118
if these boys can
fight a war together,

823
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:42,244
they can play
football together.

824
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:44,121
Now, he's
a pretty good runner.

825
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:46,832
!! Spill the wine
and take that pearl !!

826
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,421
!! Spill the wine
and take that pearl !!

827
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:53,964
Yeah, a fruitcake, huh ?

828
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:57,801
I think we can find
a place for your boy.

829
00:36:57,843 --> 00:36:58,802
Mm-hmm.

830
00:36:58,844 --> 00:37:00,971
With one or two conditions.

831
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:06,518
Hey, Sunshine.

832
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,812
! Sunshine !

833
00:37:08,854 --> 00:37:10,147
Sunshine.

834
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,273
Sunshine.

835
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:12,858
Hey, man,
all that rubbin'

836
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,276
ain't gonna make
them golden locks

837
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:17,279
grow back no faster now.
You know that, huh ?

838
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:21,825
! Sunshine,
Sunshine, Sunshine !

839
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:22,868
Sunshine, huh ?

840
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,869
Sunshine.

841
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:26,288
Yeah.
Choke it up, huh ?

842
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,874
That's cool.
I can dig it.

843
00:37:28,874 --> 00:37:29,875
Ooh !

844
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:31,126
Come on, now.

845
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:33,295
Don't leave me hangin:
bro. Come on.

846
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:35,005
Hey, he got
a little soul power.

847
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,924
Look at this man here.

848
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:39,551
He called me ''bro'' !

849
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:40,594
Hey, but, hey,

850
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,554
I liked him better
with the long hair, bro.

851
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:44,848
Reminded me
of Bertier's mama.

852
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:45,933
Ohh !

853
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:47,559
What ? What ?

854
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:50,145
Now, how do you know
what Bertier's mama looks like ?

855
00:37:50,187 --> 00:37:52,898
Brother, don't you know
me and Bertier's mama

856
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,317
went out on the town
last night, bro ?

857
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,610
What are you say  ...

858
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:58,445
Hold up, hold up.
Listen, now, Blue.

859
00:37:58,487 --> 00:38:00,030
Why are you talking about
Bertier's mama like that ?

860
00:38:00,072 --> 00:38:01,740
See, now, you
making me angry, man.

861
00:38:01,782 --> 00:38:03,784
Look like I ain't gonna
be able to take your mama

862
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:05,494
to the prom no more.

863
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:06,870
hat you laughin' at,
Jerry Buck ?

864
00:38:06,912 --> 00:38:08,205
You need to tell your mama

865
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,790
to shave them old legs
of hers, bro.

866
00:38:09,915 --> 00:38:11,208
And, Julius,
when she's done,

867
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:12,918
maybe your mama
can borrow the razor

868
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,171
and shave that old
nasty back of hers.

869
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:18,507
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait, wait, wait.

870
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:20,634
ou mad because she
lookin' like a wolf man woman.

871
00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:24,638
Hey, hey. Lastik, man,
what happened to you ?

872
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:26,932
Man, I just gave your
mama a piggyback ride,

873
00:38:27,057 --> 00:38:29,977
and she weighs twice
as much as I do.

874
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:32,563
That ain't funny.

875
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:35,357
That's--that's a mama joke.

876
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:43,866
! Listen, baby !

877
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:45,784
! Ain't no mountain high !

878
00:38:45,826 --> 00:38:47,786
! Ain't no valley low !

879
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:51,373
! Ain't no river
wide enough, baby !

880
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:53,709
! If you need me,
call me !

881
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:55,544
! No matter
where you are !

882
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:57,504
! No matter
how far !

883
00:38:57,546 --> 00:38:59,131
! No, no, darlin' !

884
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:00,799

885
00:39:00,841 --> 00:39:02,968

886
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:04,678

to worry !

887
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:06,221
! 'Cause, baby, there !

888
00:39:06,263 --> 00:39:07,556
!! Ain't no mountain
high enough !!

889
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:09,224
So, Julius, I was
thinking that we  ...

890
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:10,684
He's in the shower.

891
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:12,728
!! Ain't no mountain
low enough !!

892
00:39:12,811 --> 00:39:14,271
What do you want, man ?

893
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:17,733
You know what I want.

894
00:39:17,858 --> 00:39:19,860
Ohh !

895
00:39:19,985 --> 00:39:21,278
Ohh !

896
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:22,571
Come on !

897
00:39:22,696 --> 00:39:24,281
!! I told you !!

898
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:26,909
!! You could always
count on me !!

899
00:39:26,992 --> 00:39:28,827
Ooh ! Ooh !

900
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,832
Hey, Bertier !

901
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:35,292
Get off. Get off.

902
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:37,461
You have no idea
who you messed with, man !

903
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:38,712
There's too much
male bonding

904
00:39:38,754 --> 00:39:40,047
going on in here
for me.

905
00:39:40,172 --> 00:39:41,298
I'm out. You dig ?

906
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:42,299
All right !

907
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:44,051
What is going on here ?

908
00:39:44,176 --> 00:39:46,220
!! Ain't no river wide enough !!

909
00:39:46,303 --> 00:39:47,763
He kissed me, man !

910
00:39:47,846 --> 00:39:49,765
!! To keep me from getting
to you, babe !!

911
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,769
!! 'Cause baby there !!

912
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:56,188
! Ain't no mountain
high enough !

913
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:00,234
!! Ain't no valley low enough !!

914
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:03,946
! Ain't no river
wide enough !

915
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:06,615
! To keep me from gettin'
to you, babe !

916
00:40:06,657 --> 00:40:07,950
- Ronnie Bass.
- Yes, sir.

917
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:09,326
I like that haircut.
Get in there

918
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:10,786
and show me what
you got. Option left.

919
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:12,621
Let's go, baby.
Rookie quarterback.

920
00:40:12,663 --> 00:40:14,331
Side field, come on.

921
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:15,624
Left ! Left !

922
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:18,919
Set ! Hut !

923
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:22,631
Ball ! Ball ! Ball !

924
00:40:22,673 --> 00:40:24,967
Hard step.

925
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,260
Read the tackle.

926
00:40:26,343 --> 00:40:27,803
Got to see the pitch,
all right ?

927
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:29,221
Now,
you can throw it a mile,

928
00:40:29,346 --> 00:40:31,181
but you
can't pitch it 3 yards.

929
00:40:31,223 --> 00:40:32,224
Gotta see it.

930
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:34,226
If you don't read it,
you weave 'em.

931
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:35,185
- Rev !
- Yes, sir !

932
00:40:35,227 --> 00:40:36,186
Show him how.

933
00:40:36,228 --> 00:40:37,187
Yes, sir.

934
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,527
You want
this milk, Bertier ?

935
00:40:43,652 --> 00:40:44,987
Yeah, I'll take it, man.

936
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:45,988
You can have it.

937
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:47,823
Hey, can you slide
a bit, Gerry ?

938
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:50,534
Hey, Ray, this is
the defensive table.

939
00:40:50,534 --> 00:40:53,662
!! To get bread from dough !!

940
00:40:53,704 --> 00:40:55,247
Hi, Petey.

941
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:56,707
What's up, man ?

942
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,543
Hey, Sunshine.

943
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:01,003
It's not like I care
or nothin',

944
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:03,839
but bein' your roommate
and all, uh  ...

945
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:05,424
you was just messin'
with Bertier, right ?

946
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:07,843
You--you was just messing
with his mind, right ?

947
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:08,844
You're not really, uh  ...

948
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:11,680
What are you
talking about, Petey ?

949
00:41:11,722 --> 00:41:12,973
Look, man, it don't
matter to me, you know ?

950
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:14,850
I-if, you know, if  ...

951
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:16,685
I just got to know,
you know ? Uh  ...

952
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:19,855
If it don't matter,
what's the big deal ?

953
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,732
I got to know.

954
00:41:21,857 --> 00:41:23,025
Know what ?

955
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,694
You know what I got to know ?
Don't mess with my mind !

956
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:27,029
Looks like Coach
been keeping Petey

957
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:28,697
out in the sun
for too long, bro.

958
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:30,574
Coach.

959
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:33,202
Hey, sweetie.

960
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:34,578

961
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,455
Coach Boone ?

962
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:38,749
You did a good job

963
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:41,877
ou ran a tough
camp from what I can see.

964
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:43,921
Well, I'm very happy
to have the approval

965
00:41:44,004 --> 00:41:45,422

966

I'm 9 1 /2,

967
00:41:48,926 --> 00:41:50,552

Let me ask you something,
Mr. Campbell.

982
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:26,046
Uh-huh.

983

984
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:30,217
Oh, man, you know

00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:15,030
Man, this stuff

Yeah,

1040
00:44:16,448 --> 00:44:17,908

1042
00:44:19,868 --> 00:44:21,787
This here's

1043
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:24,873
But there are a lot
of pretty women here.

1044
00:44:24,915 --> 00:44:27,626
Hey.

1045
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:29,211
Look at 'em, Gerry.

1046
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:31,547
They hate us.

1047
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:36,260
Nah. Just a bad day.
Things'll cool down.

1048
00:44:36,343 --> 00:44:38,470
No, Gerry. They're
always gonna hate us.

1049
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,641
We don't need you here,
either, hippie boy.

1050
00:44:42,683 --> 00:44:44,935
You hear

1051
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:47,396
Hey, man.

1052
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:48,522
Hey, Julius.

1053
00:44:48,564 --> 00:44:50,816
Man, it's crazy
out here, man.

1054
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:52,818
Yeah, well,
what did you expect ?

1055
00:44:52,943 --> 00:44:56,113
I don't know. I ain't quite
expect it to be like this.

1056
00:44:56,196 --> 00:44:59,658
Ah, sorry. Julius,
this is Emma.

1057
00:45:04,288 --> 00:45:06,957
!! Now the time has come !!

1058
00:45:06,957 --> 00:45:08,834
!! Time !!

1059
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:11,420
Camp over now, huh ?

1060
00:45:11,545 --> 00:45:14,381
Back to the real world,
Bertier.

1061
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:16,967
This is what
they're integrating us for ?

1062
00:45:17,092 --> 00:45:20,012
We'd have been better off
staying where we were.

1063
00:45:22,431 --> 00:45:23,599
!! Time !!

1064
00:45:26,435 --> 00:45:27,603
!! Time !!

1065
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:33,275
Mmm.

1066
00:45:33,317 --> 00:45:36,820
Yeah, this is
my sanctuary right here.

1067
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:41,283
All this hatred and turmoil
swirling around us,

1068
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:44,161
but this  ...
this is always right.

1069
00:45:44,286 --> 00:45:46,330
Struggle.

1070
00:45:46,455 --> 00:45:48,457
Survival.

1071
00:45:48,582 --> 00:45:50,167
Victory and defeat.

1072
00:45:54,338 --> 00:45:56,298
It's just a game, Doc,
but  ...

1073
00:45:58,634 --> 00:45:59,885
I love it.

1074
00:46:02,012 --> 00:46:06,767
Coach, I'm afraid I've put you
into a no-win situation.

1075
00:46:06,892 --> 00:46:08,560
I just found out the board
didn't even think

1076
00:46:08,602 --> 00:46:10,020
you'd make it out of camp.

1077
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,313
And now that you have,

1078
00:46:11,355 --> 00:46:13,607
I've learned that
at the first sign of trouble  ...

1079
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:15,025
Trouble ?
What kind of trouble ?

1080
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:17,319
Lose a game  ...

1081
00:46:17,444 --> 00:46:18,654
they'll fire you

1082
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:21,031
and turn it back over
to Yoast.

1083
00:46:21,073 --> 00:46:23,325
One game,
just like that ?

1084
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:24,493
Mm-hmm.

1085
00:46:24,535 --> 00:46:26,161
What about my family ?

1086
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:27,204
We just got here.

1087
00:46:27,204 --> 00:46:28,747
They just expect me
to pick up and move ?

1088
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:30,040
What about my girls ?

1089
00:46:30,165 --> 00:46:33,335
I--I don't know
what to say, I  ...

1090
00:46:33,377 --> 00:46:36,046
I'm sorry, Coach.

1091
00:46:36,171 --> 00:46:37,881
! Pump, pump,
pump it up ! !

1092
00:46:37,923 --> 00:46:39,633
! Pump, pump,
pump it up ! !

1093
00:46:39,758 --> 00:46:41,677
! Pump that Titan spirit up ! !

1094
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,220
Look at 'em.

1095
00:46:43,262 --> 00:46:44,263
They come here
to watch the game,

1096
00:46:44,346 --> 00:46:47,266
and they still don't
want no part of us.

1097
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,196
! Give us more !

1098
00:47:01,238 --> 00:47:03,115
! Do your stuff,
let's go ! !

1099
00:47:10,581 --> 00:47:12,833
All right,
everybody on their feet.

1100
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:14,835
On your feet, on your feet.
Let's go, let's go.

1101
00:47:16,879 --> 00:47:18,255
Listen up.

1102
00:47:18,255 --> 00:47:19,965
I'm not gonna talk
to you tonight about  ...

1103
00:47:20,007 --> 00:47:22,843
winnin' and losin'.

1104
00:47:22,968 --> 00:47:25,679
You're already winners,

1105
00:47:25,804 --> 00:47:27,723
cause you didn't
kill each other up at camp.

1106
00:47:27,848 --> 00:47:32,269
Tonight, we got Hayfield.

1107
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:33,854
Like all the other schools
in this conference,

1108
00:47:33,979 --> 00:47:35,272
they're all white.

1109
00:47:35,397 --> 00:47:38,859
They don't have
to worry about race.

1110
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:40,736
We do.

1111
00:47:40,819 --> 00:47:44,573
But we're better
for it, men.

1112
00:47:44,698 --> 00:47:47,868
Let me tell you something.
You don't let anything  ...

1113
00:47:47,993 --> 00:47:49,912
nothin'  ...

1114
00:47:49,995 --> 00:47:51,455
come between us.

1115
00:47:51,455 --> 00:47:53,290
Nothin' tears us apart.

1116
00:47:53,332 --> 00:47:54,583
Greekmythology,

1117
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:57,878
the titans were greater
even than the gods.

1118
00:47:58,003 --> 00:48:00,464
They ruled their universe
with absolute power.

1119
00:48:00,589 --> 00:48:02,299
Well, that football field
out there tonight,

1120
00:48:02,424 --> 00:48:04,301
that's our universe.

1121
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:06,845
Let's rule it like titans.

1122
00:48:06,887 --> 00:48:08,180
Got it !

1123
00:48:14,853 --> 00:48:16,021
So the Titans defense

1124
00:48:16,146 --> 00:48:17,773
takes the field
for the first time

1125
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:19,316
against
the Hay field Hawks,

1126
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:21,151
led by quarterback
Daniel Cullum

1127
00:48:21,193 --> 00:48:23,612
on the Hawks
32-yardline.

1128
00:48:23,654 --> 00:48:24,905
Ohh !

1129
00:48:26,865 --> 00:48:28,492
We're moving like molasses
out there,

1130
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:29,785
for crying out loud !

1131
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:31,453
I mean, come on !

1132
00:48:31,495 --> 00:48:33,622
Uhh ! Ooh !

1133
00:48:33,664 --> 00:48:35,207
Mama.

1134
00:48:35,332 --> 00:48:36,625
Hmm ?

1135
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:38,919
Are all white girls
that crazy ?

1136
00:48:38,961 --> 00:48:40,212
What ?

1137
00:48:40,254 --> 00:48:42,631
You guys can do
better than that--uhh !

1138
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:44,174
Yeah !

1139
00:48:44,216 --> 00:48:46,343
Huddle up.
Fellas, huddle up.

1140
00:48:46,385 --> 00:48:47,803
Bosley ? Where's Alan ?

1141
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:49,805
Alan, you've got to
stick your man !

1142
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,640
They're gonna score on us
all night if you don't  ...

1143
00:48:51,682 --> 00:48:52,933
He's too fast, Gerry.
I can't stick with him.

1144
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:54,893
Let's go, let's go !

1145
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:56,520
22 ! Hut !

1146
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:03,360
Touchdown, Hawks !

1147
00:49:09,575 --> 00:49:11,118
Shape up that
defense, Yoast.

1148
00:49:11,243 --> 00:49:12,369
You just worry
about your offense.

1149
00:49:12,494 --> 00:49:14,538
Hey, they score again,
I'm takin' over.

1150
00:49:19,835 --> 00:49:21,086
Ready !

1151
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:22,379
That's it !

1152
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:23,672
Watch him !
Watch him !

1153
00:49:23,797 --> 00:49:24,715
Set !

1154
00:49:26,258 --> 00:49:27,551
Hut ! Hut !

1155
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:35,309
Petey, get over here !
What are you doing, son ?

1156
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:37,227
You missed the block
by a mile.

1157
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:39,563
You didn't even have the
football to fumble this time.

1158
00:49:39,688 --> 00:49:41,565
There's no excuse !
No excuse !

1159
00:49:41,607 --> 00:49:43,025
You want to play
football or not ?

1160
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,194
Do you want to
play football  ...

1161
00:49:45,277 --> 00:49:46,570
Boy, get over there
on the bench ?

1162
00:49:49,114 --> 00:49:51,283
Herb, take over for me.

1163
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:52,576
You got it.

1164
00:49:52,576 --> 00:49:55,871
Petey !
You all right ?

1165
00:49:55,913 --> 00:49:58,582
I was a 2-year starter
at G.W.

1166
00:49:58,624 --> 00:50:00,209
All this yelling
he's doing,

1167
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:02,419
it--it don't do nothing
but make me play worse.

1168
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:03,754
I can't play for this man.

1169
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:05,547
You come play
linebacker for me.

1170
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:08,217
23's killing us. I want
you to get out there,

1171
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,927
I want you
to cover him for me.

1172
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:12,054
- You want me to go in now ?
- Yeah.

1173
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:14,056
I can't ! I--I  ...

1174
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:16,016
I haven't practiced
with the defense. I can't.

1175
00:50:16,058 --> 00:50:17,851
hat doesn't matter.
Just get out there.

1176
00:50:17,893 --> 00:50:19,603
I want you to cover 23.
That's all you have to do.

1177
00:50:19,728 --> 00:50:21,188
We'll talk
about theres to fit

1178
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:22,731
when we
put this one away.

1179
00:50:22,773 --> 00:50:25,776
You think Yoast is trying to
let them score on purpose ?

1180
00:50:25,776 --> 00:50:26,777
What ?

1181
00:50:26,777 --> 00:50:27,778
Do you ?

1182
00:50:27,778 --> 00:50:29,071
Oh, come on, Herman.

1183
00:50:29,154 --> 00:50:30,447
OK, let's go.

1184
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:35,035
What is Petey
doing in there ?

1185
00:50:38,163 --> 00:50:42,084
Looks like Yoast
is trying him out on defense.

1186
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:44,211
He's taking Alan out.
Yoast !

1187
00:50:44,336 --> 00:50:45,921
Herman, Herman, Herman.

1188
00:50:45,963 --> 00:50:48,340
Come on. Let's see.
Let's see what happens.

1189
00:50:48,382 --> 00:50:49,633
It might be all right.

1190
00:50:49,675 --> 00:50:52,386
It's OK. You're OK.
You're OK. OK.

1191
00:50:52,511 --> 00:50:54,054
Don't you take out
my son !

1192
00:50:54,096 --> 00:50:56,640
He's gettin' beat like he
stole somethin', Mr. Bosley.

1193
00:50:56,682 --> 00:50:58,350
You just stay
out of it, girl !

1194
00:50:58,475 --> 00:50:59,810
He's just getting beat,
that's all I'm saying.

1195
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:00,936
Yoast !

1196
00:51:02,813 --> 00:51:05,107
Set ! 22 !
Hut hut !

1197
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:14,575
- Yeah !
- Ha !

1198
00:51:14,658 --> 00:51:15,826
Down !

1199
00:51:15,868 --> 00:51:18,662
!! Ah, yeah !!

1200
00:51:18,662 --> 00:51:20,539
Hut ! Hut, hut !

1201
00:51:21,874 --> 00:51:24,835
!! Doo doo
doot doot doot !!

1202
00:51:24,835 --> 00:51:26,128
!! Higher !!

1203
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:27,254
!! Doo doo doot !!

1204
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:28,589
!! Doo doo doot !!

1205
00:51:28,672 --> 00:51:31,508
!! Doo doo
doot doot doot !!

1206
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,135
!! La oohhoo !!

1207
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:36,430
Go, Defense.

1208
00:51:36,555 --> 00:51:38,307
!! Drummer, keep it going !!

1209
00:51:38,432 --> 00:51:39,308
Set !

1210
00:51:39,433 --> 00:51:41,268
Hut !

1211
00:51:41,393 --> 00:51:42,978
!! Right on time !!

1212
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,688
!! Blow my mind !!

1213
00:51:44,813 --> 00:51:45,814
!! Higher !!

1214
00:51:45,856 --> 00:51:46,815
!! Higher !!

1215
00:51:47,858 --> 00:51:48,984
!! Higher !!

1216
00:51:49,026 --> 00:51:49,985
!! Superstar !!

1217
00:51:54,698 --> 00:51:56,450
Yeah ! Uhh !

1218
00:51:59,578 --> 00:52:02,164
Touchdown !
Game, Titans !

1219
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:03,832
Yeah !

1220
00:52:03,874 --> 00:52:06,710
The Titans are here, y'all,
and we ain't goin' nowhere.

1221
00:52:06,752 --> 00:52:08,462
Yo, you got to be loud
all the time, man ?

1222
00:52:08,587 --> 00:52:09,755
Virginia
can hear you, baby.

1223
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:11,215
I think they all heard
you fumble, man.

1224
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:14,176
First of all, the hand.
Second of all, who won the game ?

1225
00:52:14,218 --> 00:52:15,177
My dad is  ...

1226
00:52:15,302 --> 00:52:16,637
Don't worry about it.
It's not your fault.

1227
00:52:16,762 --> 00:52:18,305
They--they like
to show off,

1228
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:19,556
and that's what they do.

1229
00:52:19,598 --> 00:52:20,891
Wait, wait, wait.
'They'' ?

1230
00:52:20,891 --> 00:52:22,017
Yeah. What ?

1231
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:23,310
I heard you say ''they.''

1232
00:52:23,352 --> 00:52:25,229
Yeah, they. Them.
Them over there.

1233
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:27,064
But what you mean by ''they''  ...
you talking about Pete  ...

1234
00:52:27,189 --> 00:52:29,191
ou're you,
and they are them.

1235
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:32,194
Gerry.

1236
00:52:32,236 --> 00:52:35,614
Hey, Gerry.
Hop in, buddy.

1237
00:52:35,656 --> 00:52:37,908
We're heading over
to the hill, Gerry.

1238
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:39,368
Everyone's
gonna be there.

1239
00:52:39,493 --> 00:52:41,537
Why don't you hang out
down here with us ?

1240
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,538
We're, you know.

1241
00:52:42,621 --> 00:52:45,499
What are you trying
to do, Gerry ?

1242
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:47,209
Listen, when
something unexpected comes,

1243
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:50,212
you just got to pick it up
and run with it.

1244
00:52:50,254 --> 00:52:54,216
I'm not running in the same
direction as you are, Gerry.

1245
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:56,051
Come with us.

1246
00:52:56,093 --> 00:52:59,930
Look, standing up
for what you believe in,

1247
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:01,890
it's all well and good,
but  ...

1248
00:53:01,932 --> 00:53:05,894
you got your priorities
real mixed up this time.

1249
00:53:05,936 --> 00:53:09,106
Are you comin'
or not, man ?

1250
00:53:09,106 --> 00:53:11,942
!! The way you stole my heart !!

1251
00:53:11,942 --> 00:53:15,654
!! You know, you could have
been a cool crook !!

1252
00:53:15,696 --> 00:53:19,408
!! And, baby,
you're so smart !!

1253
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:22,244
!! You know, you could have
been a schoolbook !!

1254
00:53:24,288 --> 00:53:25,789
Petey Jones.

1255
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:26,790
Come on, man.

1256
00:53:26,832 --> 00:53:27,958
No, man.

1257
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,419
What, man ? It's on me, man.
We party on. Let's go.

1258
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:32,546
Look--look here, man,
all right ?

1259
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:34,590
This here's Virginia.
All right ?

1260
00:53:34,673 --> 00:53:36,592
They got problems with,
you know  ...

1261
00:53:36,675 --> 00:53:38,302
They don't want us
in there, man.

1262
00:53:38,427 --> 00:53:40,846
Oh, man, that's history, bro.
It's on me. Come on.

1263
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:46,560
Woman:: !! So lonely !!

1264
00:53:46,685 --> 00:53:51,857
!! Without you !!

1265
00:53:51,899 --> 00:53:53,442
!! But our love !!

1266
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:55,277
We're full tonight, boys.

1267
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:58,030
What ? There's tables
all over the place, man.

1268
00:53:58,155 --> 00:53:59,740
What are you
talking about ?

1269
00:53:59,865 --> 00:54:01,742
Well, this is
my establishment.

1270
00:54:01,867 --> 00:54:04,912
I reserve the right
to refuse service to anybody.

1271
00:54:04,995 --> 00:54:07,581
Yeah, that means
you, too, hippie boy.

1272
00:54:07,706 --> 00:54:09,041
Now, y'all want
somethin' to eat,

1273
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:10,542
you can take these boys
out back

1274
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:12,461
and pick it up
from the kitchen.

1275
00:54:12,544 --> 00:54:13,837
What'd I tell you,
man ?

1276
00:54:13,879 --> 00:54:15,172
Yo, come on, Petey, man !

1277
00:54:15,172 --> 00:54:16,632
Petey,
I didn't know, man.

1278
00:54:16,715 --> 00:54:18,759
I told you ! What you
mean you didn't know ?!

1279
00:54:18,842 --> 00:54:20,010
You think I was
playing with you ?!

1280
00:54:20,052 --> 00:54:21,428
Man, he didn't know,
Petey.

1281
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:22,930
Blue, he don't
want to know.

1282
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:25,557
You pull some crap
like that,

1283
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:26,850
you better be able
to back it up.

1284
00:54:26,892 --> 00:54:28,185
Man,
let's go, man.

1285
00:54:28,185 --> 00:54:29,728
Why don't you
cool out ? Cool out !

1286
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:30,896
Let's go, Rev.

1287
00:54:30,938 --> 00:54:33,315
Man,
let's go, man.

1288
00:54:33,357 --> 00:54:34,316
What happened ?

1289
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:36,610
This man acting
a fool tonight, man.

1290
00:54:36,735 --> 00:54:37,653
Petey.

1291
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:39,196
Man, don't even talk
to that man, man.

1292
00:54:39,238 --> 00:54:41,031
He acting all crazy
and stuff, man.

1293
00:54:41,031 --> 00:54:42,324
It don't even
make no sense.

1294
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:43,617
Petey.

1295
00:54:43,659 --> 00:54:45,327
He know the man's
from out of town.

1296
00:54:47,496 --> 00:54:49,623
5 times--5 times,
player of the week.

1297
00:54:49,748 --> 00:54:52,167
He's not some
walk-on scrub, Yoast.

1298
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:54,336
The boy's a player.
He's a star.

1299
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:55,963
And he busted
his butt for you.

1300
00:54:56,088 --> 00:54:58,048
This is all your doing,
you blacks.

1301
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:00,175
That is enough.

1302
00:55:00,217 --> 00:55:01,677
It's my call.

1303
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,970
Now listen.

1304
00:55:03,095 --> 00:55:05,347
You just go on
home now, Fred,

1305
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:07,808
before you do something
that you're going to regret.

1306
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,942
Yeah, well  ...

1307
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:18,485
I guess we won't be seeing
much of him, huh ?

1308
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,987
I will.

1309
00:55:20,112 --> 00:55:21,655
He's on the deacon
board with me.

1310
00:55:24,533 --> 00:55:26,660
All right,
listen, about Petey  ...

1311
00:55:26,785 --> 00:55:28,370
no thanks required,
Coach.

1312
00:55:30,247 --> 00:55:31,123
Thanks ?

1313
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:33,959
You challenged
my authority

1314
00:55:34,084 --> 00:55:36,420
in front of the entire
football team, Coach.

1315
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,547
Now, you think you're
doing these boys a favor

1316
00:55:38,589 --> 00:55:41,133
taking them aside every time
I come down on them,

1317
00:55:41,258 --> 00:55:45,095
protecting them
from big bad Boone.

1318
00:55:45,137 --> 00:55:47,139
You're cutting my legs
from under me.

1319
00:55:48,265 --> 00:55:49,516
Some of the boys
just don't respond well

1320
00:55:49,558 --> 00:55:50,893
to public criticism.

1321
00:55:50,976 --> 00:55:52,311
I tell them
what they need to know,

1322
00:55:52,436 --> 00:55:54,146
but I don't
humiliate them

1323
00:55:54,271 --> 00:55:56,899
in front of the team.

1324
00:55:56,982 --> 00:55:58,567
Which boys are you
talking about ?

1325
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:01,904
Which ones
you talking about ?

1326
00:56:01,987 --> 00:56:04,031
I come down on Bertier.
I don't see you coddle him.

1327
00:56:05,824 --> 00:56:07,117
Come down on Sunshine.

1328
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:09,912
Don't see you grab his hand,
take him off to the side.

1329
00:56:09,995 --> 00:56:13,207
Which boys
are you talking about ?

1330
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:15,292
Now, I may be a mean cuss,

1331
00:56:15,417 --> 00:56:16,877
but I'm the same
mean cuss

1332
00:56:17,002 --> 00:56:20,297
with everybody out there
on that football field.

1333
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:21,298
The world
don't give a damn

1334
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:22,633
about how sensitive
these kids are  ...

1335
00:56:22,758 --> 00:56:25,177
Especially
the young black kids.

1336
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:28,180
You ain't doing
these kids a favor

1337
00:56:28,222 --> 00:56:29,723
by patronizing them.

1338
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:33,894
You're crippling them.

1339
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:36,313
You're crippling them
for life.

1340
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:42,611
Hey.

1341
00:56:45,489 --> 00:56:47,032
Gerry,
what are you doing ?

1342
00:56:47,157 --> 00:56:49,034
I'm going down
to the Berg.

1343
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:50,035
The Berg ?

1344
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,036
Yep.

1345
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:53,497
What are you doing
at the Berg ?

1346
00:56:53,539 --> 00:56:55,499
I'm going to play
basketball with Julius.

1347
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:56,792
Then we're going to
comeback here for dinner.

1348
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:59,169
Gerry, if your father
was still alive  ...

1349
00:56:59,211 --> 00:57:00,796
Ma, would  ...

1350
00:57:00,879 --> 00:57:03,173
Just give him a chance.
Just get to know him.

1351
00:57:03,215 --> 00:57:04,383
Listen to him
for 2 seconds.

1352
00:57:04,508 --> 00:57:06,927
I don't want
to get to know him.

1353
00:57:08,887 --> 00:57:11,223
You are coming to church
with your mother.

1354
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:15,644
Right, right, right !

1355
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:16,812
He's mine !

1356
00:57:16,854 --> 00:57:17,813
Hut !

1357
00:57:24,111 --> 00:57:25,195
ou blew
your assignment !

1358
00:57:25,237 --> 00:57:26,989
Man, I'm covering for you.
Don't get in my face.

1359
00:57:27,072 --> 00:57:29,116
Yo, cool out.
Cool out.

1360
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:31,243
Where you at ?

1361
00:57:31,368 --> 00:57:32,703
What planet
you on tonight ?

1362
00:57:32,828 --> 00:57:34,955
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1363
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,123
I mean, it's fine, man.

1364
00:57:36,206 --> 00:57:37,207
I knew you was going
to stand me up.

1365
00:57:37,249 --> 00:57:38,292
I figured you weren't
going to make out

1366
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:39,376
to the Berg, no way.

1367
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:40,419
I knew you was all talk,

1368
00:57:40,502 --> 00:57:41,420
but now you
making us look bad

1369
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:42,421
out there on the field.

1370
00:57:42,504 --> 00:57:44,131
Don't talk to me, man.

1371
00:57:44,256 --> 00:57:45,507
You ain't got nothing
to say to me.

1372
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:47,843
Why the clouds,
Sunshine ?

1373
00:57:47,885 --> 00:57:49,553
I can't make
that pitch, Petey.

1374
00:57:49,595 --> 00:57:51,722
You ain't gonna
never play anyway,

1375
00:57:51,847 --> 00:57:54,266
unless we're up
by 50 points.

1376
00:57:54,391 --> 00:57:55,434
And seeing as how
we ain't never gonna be

1377
00:57:55,517 --> 00:57:56,518
up by no 50 points,

1378
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,437
you might as well
just sit back, relax,

1379
00:57:58,562 --> 00:57:59,855
and enjoy the bench.

1380
00:57:59,897 --> 00:58:01,523
How's it going, yo ?

1381
00:58:01,565 --> 00:58:04,026
Man, I didn't sign up
to play like this.

1382
00:58:04,109 --> 00:58:05,861
These guys we're playing
got no heart.

1383
00:58:05,986 --> 00:58:07,571
We play like this
against Groveton,

1384
00:58:07,613 --> 00:58:08,822
we're going down.

1385
00:58:08,864 --> 00:58:11,033
OK, Offense.
Offense, let's go.

1386
00:58:14,203 --> 00:58:15,454
Hut !

1387
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:21,335
Touchdown, Titans !

1388
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,170
Game, Titans !

1389
00:58:31,887 --> 00:58:33,180
How you doing, Coach ?

1390
00:58:33,222 --> 00:58:35,057
Good morning.

1391
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,058
Where's your dad ?

1392
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:37,184
He's in his office.

1393
00:58:37,226 --> 00:58:38,602
Nicky, you allright ?

1394
00:58:38,644 --> 00:58:40,312
Yes, Daddy.

1395
00:58:40,354 --> 00:58:41,313
OK.

1396
00:58:41,438 --> 00:58:42,856
What you doing ?

1397
00:58:42,898 --> 00:58:45,776
Shooting some hoops.

1398
00:58:45,901 --> 00:58:47,361
Want to play ?

1399
00:58:53,784 --> 00:58:55,494
I just did my nails.

1400
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:59,498
How you doing ?
Tyrell.

1401
00:58:59,623 --> 00:59:01,250
Coach--ahem  ...
if you don't need me,

1402
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:02,501
I'm going to  ...

1403
00:59:02,626 --> 00:59:03,961
I'm going
to wait out back.

1404
00:59:04,086 --> 00:59:04,962
All right, Herb.

1405
00:59:06,505 --> 00:59:08,632
Coach Boone, to what
do I owe this surprise ?

1406
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:09,925
Have a seat.

1407
00:59:11,969 --> 00:59:13,345
I'll get straight to it.

1408
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:14,805
We won't survive
another game

1409
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:16,265
like the one we played
last Friday,

1410
00:59:16,348 --> 00:59:19,351
so I spoke to Mr. Vernon
the math teacher,

1411
00:59:19,393 --> 00:59:22,104
asked him to look at
the game fi lm from Groveton,

1412
00:59:22,187 --> 00:59:24,106
who we got next week.

1413
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:27,109
I asked him
to analyze it for me.

1414
00:59:27,192 --> 00:59:29,236
Every coach has
certain tendencies  ...

1415
00:59:30,654 --> 00:59:32,489
All of them
except Ed Henry.

1416
00:59:32,531 --> 00:59:34,408
The only time
we'd be seeing Ed Henry

1417
00:59:34,533 --> 00:59:36,243
is at the state
championship.

1418
00:59:36,285 --> 00:59:37,828
Mm-hmm.

1419
00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:45,961
Well, gosh, this is  ...

1420
00:59:46,003 --> 00:59:47,546
this is great stuff  ...

1421
00:59:47,671 --> 00:59:49,965
Every quarter
broken down,

1422
00:59:50,007 --> 00:59:51,967
how many times they run
each play. I mean  ...

1423
00:59:52,009 --> 00:59:54,428
You like that, huh ?

1424
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:57,306
We'll be very tough
defensively with this.

1425
00:59:57,431 --> 00:59:58,849
I think so.

1426
01:00:00,184 --> 01:00:02,186
I brought Nicky by.

1427
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:03,729
She was asking me
about Sheryl.

1428
01:00:03,854 --> 01:00:04,855
I'm getting
ready to take her over

1429
01:00:04,897 --> 01:00:06,982
to some of
her friends' house.

1430
01:00:07,024 --> 01:00:08,901
Any time you want to
bring her by the house,

1431
01:00:08,984 --> 01:00:10,694
we'd be more than
happy to have her.

1432
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:29,463
Oh, he's so cute.

1433
01:00:29,588 --> 01:00:32,007
He's in
my third period class.

1434
01:00:34,176 --> 01:00:37,179
What y' all staring
at old Sunshine for ?

1435
01:00:37,304 --> 01:00:38,889
I'm the one dominating
on the field.

1436
01:00:39,014 --> 01:00:40,224
He ain't played
a minute all year.

1437
01:00:40,307 --> 01:00:42,017
Who cares
about the field ?

1438
01:00:42,017 --> 01:00:44,019
Well, I don't want to be
the one to break your heart,

1439
01:00:44,144 --> 01:00:45,729
but Sunshine's
from California.

1440
01:00:45,771 --> 01:00:47,731
Yeah. A California
dreamboat.

1441
01:00:47,773 --> 01:00:49,316
No.

1442
01:00:49,441 --> 01:00:51,902
Sunshine
is from California.

1443
01:00:51,902 --> 01:00:53,779
He's a Californian  ...

1444
01:00:53,862 --> 01:00:55,322
You talking
to my girl ?

1445
01:00:55,364 --> 01:00:57,741
I don't see any
livestock around here,

1446
01:00:57,783 --> 01:01:00,619
so I don't know what
you talkin' 'bout.

1447
01:01:00,661 --> 01:01:02,037
Ohh.

1448
01:01:03,455 --> 01:01:04,331
It's a fight !

1449
01:01:04,456 --> 01:01:05,457
Guys, stop it !

1450
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:06,959
Get off me. Get off me.

1451
01:01:07,084 --> 01:01:08,210
Hey !

1452
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:10,671
You want some ?

1453
01:01:10,796 --> 01:01:12,548
Hey, hey, break it up.

1454
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:14,049
Break  ...

1455
01:01:14,091 --> 01:01:15,217
et your hands
off me, man !

1456
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:17,177
Hey, get off me !

1457
01:01:17,219 --> 01:01:18,262
Come here, man.

1458
01:01:18,345 --> 01:01:20,514
Aah !

1459
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:23,100
Petey, get these girls
out of here.

1460
01:01:23,183 --> 01:01:25,102
Get out of here !

1461
01:01:25,185 --> 01:01:26,103
Uncle Tom traitor !

1462
01:01:26,186 --> 01:01:27,104
Uncle Tom !

1463
01:01:27,229 --> 01:01:28,939
I know you didn't call me
no Uncle Tom.

1464
01:01:28,981 --> 01:01:30,774
Y'all better
back off me now, man.

1465
01:01:30,816 --> 01:01:32,109
Go ! Move !

1466
01:01:32,109 --> 01:01:33,110
Looks like you went
to the zoo

1467
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:35,237
and made some
new friends, Bertier.

1468
01:01:35,279 --> 01:01:39,116
Oh, big smart guy, huh ?

1469
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,409
!! Ah !!

1470
01:01:40,492 --> 01:01:42,077
!! Ahah !!

1471
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:44,121
!! Ahah !!

1472
01:01:44,121 --> 01:01:46,540
!! Ahah !!

1473
01:01:46,582 --> 01:01:47,249
!! Ah !!

1474
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:49,126
!! Ahah !!

1475
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:50,711
Marie
has asked about Sheryl.

1476
01:01:50,836 --> 01:01:52,254
Wanted to know if she could
come over and spend the night.

1477
01:01:52,254 --> 01:01:54,256
I told her I'd run it by you,
see what you thought.

1478
01:01:54,256 --> 01:01:55,799
Yeah.

1479
01:01:55,841 --> 01:01:56,967
She's over
at the Boones' tonight.

1480
01:01:57,092 --> 01:01:58,677
I was going to swing by

1481
01:01:58,802 --> 01:02:00,137
on my way home
and pick her up.

1482
01:02:00,137 --> 01:02:02,431
Over at the Boones', huh ?

1483
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:03,682
Yeah.

1484
01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:09,855
So that's the way
it is, huh ?

1485
01:02:09,897 --> 01:02:11,023
Yeah, you haven't
changed a bit.

1486
01:02:11,148 --> 01:02:12,816
You was the one trying
to please everybody,

1487
01:02:12,858 --> 01:02:14,443
be the nice guy.

1488
01:02:14,526 --> 01:02:17,446
Sooner or later,
a man's got to pick sides.

1489
01:02:18,739 --> 01:02:21,533
As for me, well, I'm  ...
I'm not going to put myself

1490
01:02:21,575 --> 01:02:23,577
- through the rest of the season
with that uppity  ...

1491
01:02:23,702 --> 01:02:25,996
I brought you here.

1492
01:02:26,038 --> 01:02:28,540
I want you with me,

1493
01:02:28,582 --> 01:02:30,626
but you got to do
what you got to do.

1494
01:02:35,589 --> 01:02:36,757
That's all
you can say to me

1495
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,300
after all
we've been through ?

1496
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:39,301
Do what you got to do ?

1497
01:02:39,426 --> 01:02:40,427
Hey, Herb  ...

1498
01:02:40,469 --> 01:02:41,470
You go to hell.

1499
01:02:52,481 --> 01:02:53,857
That veer's
getting better.

1500
01:02:53,899 --> 01:02:55,484
I'll admit that.

1501
01:02:55,526 --> 01:02:57,027
But you're still weak
on the left side.

1502
01:02:57,152 --> 01:02:58,612
We're not weak
on the left side.

1503
01:02:58,654 --> 01:03:01,198
We just got to work harder
on the left side, that's all.

1504
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,950
- That's not the problem.
- What is the problem ?

1505
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:04,868
You think it is, but it ain't.
It's your pass reads.

1506
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:06,453
It's not  ...
It's a run anyway.

1507
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,871
It's not a pass.
The veer is a run.

1508
01:03:07,913 --> 01:03:10,082
All right, you two,
that's enough of that.

1509
01:03:10,207 --> 01:03:13,502
Sheryl, don't you want
to play with Nicky ?

1510
01:03:13,544 --> 01:03:16,338
I hate playing
with dolls.

1511
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,882
I'm not playing.
I'm accessorizing.

1512
01:03:18,924 --> 01:03:20,092
Yeah, why don't you
go accessorize ?

1513
01:03:20,217 --> 01:03:22,636
Don't you want to go
accessorize with  ...

1514
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:26,932
Hey, ''Coach Coon ! ''

1515
01:03:29,518 --> 01:03:32,187
In the back.
In the back.

1516
01:03:32,229 --> 01:03:34,189
Mommy !

1517
01:03:56,545 --> 01:03:57,671
Where's Coach, man ?

1518
01:03:57,713 --> 01:03:58,672
What do he want
with us now ?

1519
01:03:58,797 --> 01:04:00,382
Coaches ain't called
this meeting tonight.

1520
01:04:00,424 --> 01:04:01,383
We did.

1521
01:04:01,425 --> 01:04:02,718
We outta here.

1522
01:04:02,801 --> 01:04:04,553
 all gonna
walk out on your teammate ?

1523
01:04:04,595 --> 01:04:05,554
He say he got
something to say.

1524
01:04:05,596 --> 01:04:06,555
Y'all got
to listen to him.

1525
01:04:06,597 --> 01:04:07,848
Turn around,
turn around.

1526
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:09,433
Where you going ?
Turn around.

1527
01:04:09,516 --> 01:04:11,435
Coach Boone brought us
this far, y'all,

1528
01:04:11,518 --> 01:04:14,313
but he ain't going to be
there for us forever, man.

1529
01:04:14,438 --> 01:04:16,982
So what ?
We won a few games.

1530
01:04:17,107 --> 01:04:20,027
And y'all fools
think that's something ?

1531
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:21,862
Man, that ain't
nothing, y'all.

1532
01:04:21,904 --> 01:04:23,405
And you know what else ?

1533
01:04:23,447 --> 01:04:25,574
We ain't nothing, either.

1534
01:04:25,616 --> 01:04:28,827
Yeah, we came together
in camp. Cool.

1535
01:04:28,869 --> 01:04:30,120
But then
we're right back here,

1536
01:04:30,162 --> 01:04:31,580
and the world tells us

1537
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:33,207
that they don't want us
to be together.

1538
01:04:33,290 --> 01:04:34,750
We fall apart

1539
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:37,419
like we ain't a damn bit
of nothing, man.

1540
01:04:37,461 --> 01:04:39,588
And y' all think
we done won something ?

1541
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:42,132
Man, we ain't won
nothing, y'all  ...

1542
01:04:42,174 --> 01:04:44,009
Nothing.

1543
01:04:44,134 --> 01:04:45,302
Rev, what's
that you're always

1544
01:04:45,302 --> 01:04:46,428
telling me
when I get sick

1545
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:49,223
of trying to keep up
with my grades and stuff ?

1546
01:04:49,306 --> 01:04:51,600
! Even youths !

1547
01:04:51,725 --> 01:04:53,644
! Grow tired and weary !

1548
01:04:55,062 --> 01:04:57,439
! Even young men
stumble and fall !

1549
01:04:57,481 --> 01:04:59,942
! But those who trust
in the Lord !

1550
01:05:00,025 --> 01:05:03,070
! Will renew
their strength !

1551
01:05:03,195 --> 01:05:04,613
Say amen.

1552
01:05:04,655 --> 01:05:06,490
Amen. That's what
I'm talking about.

1553
01:05:06,615 --> 01:05:08,325
Amen--amen, right ?

1554
01:05:08,367 --> 01:05:09,618
That's right, Rev.

1555
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:10,869
!! They will soar !!

1556
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:12,955
!! On wings
like eagles !!

1557
01:05:13,038 --> 01:05:15,082
! Oh, like eagles, y'all !

1558
01:05:15,207 --> 01:05:16,959
! Like eagles, y'all !

1559
01:05:17,084 --> 01:05:18,669
! They will walk !

1560
01:05:18,794 --> 01:05:21,255
! And not grow faint !

1561
01:05:21,338 --> 01:05:23,924
Yeah.
Can I get an amen ?

1562
01:05:24,049 --> 01:05:25,509
Yeah !

1563
01:05:27,052 --> 01:05:28,470
Yeah.

1564
01:05:28,512 --> 01:05:29,471
Yeah.

1565
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:34,810
We're playing Groveton
Friday night, y'all.

1566
01:05:34,852 --> 01:05:37,104
You all gonna play like
you ain't got no heart ?

1567
01:05:37,187 --> 01:05:38,355
No !

1568
01:05:38,397 --> 01:05:39,773
Do you all want
a victory ?

1569
01:05:39,815 --> 01:05:40,816
Yeah !

1570
01:05:40,858 --> 01:05:42,359
Do you all want
a victory ?

1571
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:43,485
Yeah !

1572
01:05:43,527 --> 01:05:44,528
Turn in !

1573
01:05:48,824 --> 01:05:49,700
Yeah !

1574
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:53,537
Like I said,

1575
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:54,955
we will not be
intimidated.

1576
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,582
We're going to play
football games.

1577
01:05:56,665 --> 01:05:59,418
Hatred, violence
will not intimidate us.

1578
01:05:59,501 --> 01:06:00,419
Is that
why you need

1579
01:06:00,544 --> 01:06:01,587
the state troopers,
Coach ?

1580
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:03,839
Look, I don't need no
John Brown state troopers.

1581
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,090
And you can tell whoever
threw this brick

1582
01:06:05,132 --> 01:06:06,133
through my window

1583
01:06:06,258 --> 01:06:07,676
they can come visit me
anytime.

1584
01:06:07,718 --> 01:06:08,677
I'll be at home.

1585
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:09,970
I think it's time
you stopped

1586
01:06:10,012 --> 01:06:12,222
antagonizing everybody and
learned a little humility.

1587
01:06:12,264 --> 01:06:13,390
Humility, huh ?

1588
01:06:13,432 --> 01:06:15,809
You know, if you could
just keep your mouth shut

1589
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:17,686
and if you didn't
brag so much  ...

1590
01:06:17,686 --> 01:06:19,188
I see.
So you're blaming me

1591
01:06:19,271 --> 01:06:20,314
for what happened
last night ?

1592
01:06:20,439 --> 01:06:22,858
No. I am talking about
setting a good example

1593
01:06:22,983 --> 01:06:24,693
for our boys
and for the community.

1594
01:06:24,735 --> 01:06:26,570
I don't scratch my head
unless it itches,

1595
01:06:26,612 --> 01:06:28,572
and I don't dance unless
I hear some music.

1596
01:06:28,614 --> 01:06:30,991
I will not be intimidated.
That's just the way it is.

1597
01:06:31,116 --> 01:06:32,618
If you want to carry
your sinful pride with you

1598
01:06:32,701 --> 01:06:34,203
to your grave,
that's your business,

1599
01:06:34,286 --> 01:06:36,455
But when your sins
end anger my little girl,

1600
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:38,165
it becomes mine.

1601
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,583
My sins ?

1602
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:41,585
You think my sins
had something to do

1603
01:06:41,585 --> 01:06:43,170
with what happened
last night ?

1604
01:06:43,212 --> 01:06:45,047
I'm sorry about what
happened to your daughter,

1605
01:06:45,172 --> 01:06:46,465
I really am,

1606
01:06:46,590 --> 01:06:47,925
but may be you got
a small taste

1607
01:06:48,008 --> 01:06:49,718
of what my girls
go through.

1608
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,428
Hmm ?

1609
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:53,597
Welcome to my life, Yoast.

1610
01:06:55,182 --> 01:06:56,141
Shh, shh !

1611
01:07:01,772 --> 01:07:04,024
What's going on ?

1612
01:07:04,066 --> 01:07:05,150
Coach.

1613
01:07:07,486 --> 01:07:09,154
Uh, we wanted
to let you know

1614
01:07:09,196 --> 01:07:10,155
we was going to warm up

1615
01:07:10,197 --> 01:07:12,366
a little different
tonight.

1616
01:07:12,449 --> 01:07:14,952
This is the first
true test of the season

1617
01:07:15,035 --> 01:07:16,954
for the undefeated
T. C. Williams Titans,

1618
01:07:17,037 --> 01:07:18,914
cause tonight,
they're going up against

1619
01:07:18,914 --> 01:07:21,792
the undefeated
Groveton Lions.

1620
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:24,211
Their all-state nose guard
Kip Tyler

1621
01:07:24,253 --> 01:07:26,630
is as mean as
a copper head snake.

1622
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:27,631
Raah !

1623
01:07:27,673 --> 01:07:31,468
And here come
the Titans.

1624
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:34,096
They're playing in front
of a capacity crowd

1625
01:07:34,221 --> 01:07:36,223
for the first time
this season.

1626
01:07:36,265 --> 01:07:37,641
! Ha, real good !

1627
01:07:37,683 --> 01:07:39,101
! Hoo, ha, we feel !

1628
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:40,811
! Hoo, ha, real good !

1629
01:07:40,811 --> 01:07:42,521
! Hoo, ha, we feel !

1630
01:07:42,563 --> 01:07:44,481
! Hoo, ha, real good !

1631
01:07:44,523 --> 01:07:46,233
! Hoo, ha, we feel !

1632
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:47,776
! Hoo, ha, real good !

1633
01:07:47,818 --> 01:07:49,945
! Hoo, ha, we feel !

1634
01:07:49,945 --> 01:07:51,280
! Hoo, ha, real good !

1635
01:07:51,363 --> 01:07:53,866
!! Hoo, ha, we feel !!

1636
01:07:53,949 --> 01:07:55,492
Julius Campbell

1637
01:07:55,534 --> 01:07:56,577
is playing strong side
linebacker.

1638
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:57,578
Sheryl.

1639
01:07:57,661 --> 01:07:58,579
He's so good.
He's got all-American  ...

1640
01:07:58,662 --> 01:08:00,122
Sheryl.

1641
01:08:00,205 --> 01:08:02,875
- And Gerry Bertier  ...
- Sheryl.

1642
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:06,378
I do not care.

1643
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,255
5, 6 !

1644
01:08:08,297 --> 01:08:10,299
5, 6, 7, 8 !

1645
01:08:10,424 --> 01:08:12,301
! Everywhere we go !

1646
01:08:12,384 --> 01:08:14,303
! Everywhere we go !

1647
01:08:14,386 --> 01:08:16,305
! People wanna know !

1648
01:08:16,388 --> 01:08:17,973
! People wanna know !

1649
01:08:18,098 --> 01:08:20,309
! Who we are !

1650
01:08:20,434 --> 01:08:22,311
! Who we are !

1651
01:08:22,394 --> 01:08:24,188
! So we tell them !

1652
01:08:24,271 --> 01:08:26,440
! So we tell them !

1653
01:08:26,523 --> 01:08:28,525
!! We are the Titans !!

1654
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:30,319
!! We are the Titans !!

1655
01:08:30,444 --> 01:08:32,446
! The mighty, mighty
Titans !

1656
01:08:32,529 --> 01:08:34,323
! The mighty,
mighty Titans !

1657
01:08:34,406 --> 01:08:36,325
!! Ooh, ah, oh, yeah !!

1658
01:08:36,408 --> 01:08:37,993
!! Ooh, ah, oh, yeah !!

1659
01:08:38,118 --> 01:08:40,829
Who do they think they are,
the Beatles ?

1660
01:08:40,871 --> 01:08:42,331
!! Ooh, ah, oh, yeah !!

1661
01:08:42,414 --> 01:08:44,875
All right, quit gawking.
Warm up.

1662
01:08:44,917 --> 01:08:46,001
Tyler.

1663
01:08:46,126 --> 01:08:47,461
Coach ?

1664
01:08:47,544 --> 01:08:49,338
Shut 'em up--hard.

1665
01:08:54,176 --> 01:08:55,469
Ready !

1666
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,639
Omaha, Budds, omaha.

1667
01:08:58,764 --> 01:08:59,723
Set !

1668
01:08:59,765 --> 01:09:00,724
Omaha !

1669
01:09:02,017 --> 01:09:03,018
Hike !

1670
01:09:07,523 --> 01:09:09,483
Song's over, Sambo.

1671
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,030
Ohh.

1672
01:09:16,949 --> 01:09:18,909
Yo, man.

1673
01:09:18,909 --> 01:09:21,370
Let's go, baby.
Let's go, let's go.

1674
01:09:23,205 --> 01:09:24,665
What happened,
Lastik ?

1675
01:09:24,748 --> 01:09:25,958
I--I audibled.

1676
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:27,626
Rev, I swear to God
I audibled.

1677
01:09:27,751 --> 01:09:29,378
- All right, fellas, coming through.
- I didn't hear it.

1678
01:09:29,503 --> 01:09:30,754
Swear to God.

1679
01:09:30,796 --> 01:09:31,755
Let's
take a look at that, son.

1680
01:09:31,797 --> 01:09:34,049
Uhh.

1681
01:09:34,091 --> 01:09:35,217
Well, he broke a bone
in the wrist.

1682
01:09:35,259 --> 01:09:36,760
He won't be throwing
any more this season.

1683
01:09:36,802 --> 01:09:38,220
Ahh.

1684
01:09:38,262 --> 01:09:39,930
You got one minute,
Coach.

1685
01:09:39,972 --> 01:09:42,808
Take the other
time-out, Coach.

1686
01:09:44,101 --> 01:09:45,060
Ronnie Bass !

1687
01:09:45,102 --> 01:09:46,937
Coach, Rev's
going back in, right ?

1688
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:48,564
Not at quarterback, son.

1689
01:09:48,647 --> 01:09:49,565
I can't make
that pitch, Coach.

1690
01:09:49,648 --> 01:09:50,566
Yes, you can.

1691
01:09:52,276 --> 01:09:53,861
When I was 1 5 years old,

1692
01:09:53,944 --> 01:09:55,404
I lost my mother
and my father

1693
01:09:55,529 --> 01:09:57,948
in the same month, Ronnie  ...
the same month.

1694
01:09:57,948 --> 01:10:00,075
1 2 brothers and sisters.
I was the youngest one,

1695
01:10:00,117 --> 01:10:01,785
but they were all
looking up to me.

1696
01:10:01,827 --> 01:10:03,954
Now, I wasn't ready yet,
either, but they needed me.

1697
01:10:03,996 --> 01:10:06,081
Your team
needs you tonight.

1698
01:10:06,123 --> 01:10:07,249
You're the colonel.

1699
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:08,292
You're going to command
your troops tonight.

1700
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:09,376
- Do you understand ?
- Yes, sir.

1701
01:10:09,418 --> 01:10:11,879
Twins right,
48, zero read.

1702
01:10:11,962 --> 01:10:13,672
Let's go.

1703
01:10:13,797 --> 01:10:14,673
Let's go.

1704
01:10:16,258 --> 01:10:17,676
Let's go.

1705
01:10:17,801 --> 01:10:19,261
What's the matter ?
Haven't you ever seen

1706
01:10:19,261 --> 01:10:20,888
a football injury before,
you wimps ?

1707
01:10:20,971 --> 01:10:22,097
Let's go.
Show some life in those legs.

1708
01:10:22,139 --> 01:10:23,557
I got it. It's going
to be all right.

1709
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:26,560
Budds,
you release this time.

1710
01:10:26,602 --> 01:10:27,561
Louie, let him through,
all right ?

1711
01:10:27,686 --> 01:10:29,438
- Just let him through.
- What ?

1712
01:10:29,563 --> 01:10:30,439
Trust me.

1713
01:10:30,564 --> 01:10:32,816
You had 1 2 brothers
and sisters ?

1714
01:10:32,858 --> 01:10:34,109
8

1715
01:10:34,151 --> 01:10:35,444
Yeah.
1 2 sounds better.

1716
01:10:39,448 --> 01:10:40,407
Ready !

1717
01:10:42,034 --> 01:10:43,577
Set !

1718
01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:44,703
Blue, 21 !

1719
01:10:44,828 --> 01:10:45,996
Blue, 21 !

1720
01:10:45,996 --> 01:10:47,289
Hut !

1721
01:10:52,461 --> 01:10:54,129
Ha ha ha !

1722
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:55,464
Whoo !

1723
01:10:56,632 --> 01:10:58,008
Whoo !

1724
01:10:59,635 --> 01:11:01,220
Ref ! .
Unnecessary roughness !

1725
01:11:01,303 --> 01:11:02,346
That's a penalty !

1726
01:11:02,471 --> 01:11:04,473
On the quarterback ? Are
you kidding me, Coach ?

1727
01:11:07,851 --> 01:11:09,436
!! Na na na na !!

1728
01:11:09,478 --> 01:11:12,022
Whoo-hoo-hoo !
Did you see that, man ?

1729
01:11:12,147 --> 01:11:14,233
That's a bad
white boy, man.

1730
01:11:14,316 --> 01:11:15,651
Hike !

1731
01:11:15,734 --> 01:11:17,778
!! Na na na na !!

1732
01:11:17,861 --> 01:11:19,446
!! Hey, hey, hey !!

1733
01:11:19,488 --> 01:11:21,073
!! Good-bye !!

1734
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:23,325
We've got ourselves
a football player.

1735
01:11:23,325 --> 01:11:24,326
Hut !

1736
01:11:24,326 --> 01:11:26,036
!! Na na na na !!

1737
01:11:26,078 --> 01:11:27,788
!! Hey, hey, hey !!

1738
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:29,623
- !! Good-bye !!

1739
01:11:29,665 --> 01:11:32,459
Hut !

1740
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:34,336
!! Na na na na !!

1741
01:11:34,378 --> 01:11:35,963
!! Hey, hey, hey !!

1742
01:11:36,046 --> 01:11:37,506
!! It's all right !!

1743
01:11:37,548 --> 01:11:39,091
!! Give it tome

1744
01:11:40,676 --> 01:11:42,219

1745
01:11:42,261 --> 01:11:44,805

!! Good-bye !!

1747
01:11:49,226 --> 01:11:52,271
All right, listen up,

1748
01:11:52,354 --> 01:11:54,231
Listen up, listen up.
Listen up.

1749
01:11:54,273 --> 01:11:55,232
Whoa.

1750
01:11:56,942 --> 01:11:58,360
Game ball  ...

1751
01:11:59,945 --> 01:12:01,113
Ronnie Bass.

1752
01:12:04,575 --> 01:12:05,868
Hey, this ball
right here  ...

1753
01:12:05,951 --> 01:12:06,869
hey, this ball
right here

1754
01:12:06,952 --> 01:12:08,370
goes to the real king
right here.

1755
01:12:08,412 --> 01:12:09,705
Thanks for teaching me
the veer, Rev.

1756
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:10,706
Aw, come on.

1757
01:12:10,831 --> 01:12:12,249
Rev !

1758
01:12:12,249 --> 01:12:13,709
Rev ! Rev ! Rev !

1759
01:12:13,834 --> 01:12:15,252
- Rev ! Rev ! Rev !
- Ow !

1760
01:12:15,294 --> 01:12:17,671
Rev ! Rev ! Rev !

1761
01:12:17,713 --> 01:12:19,840
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on.

1762
01:12:19,882 --> 01:12:21,592
Coach ?

1763
01:12:21,675 --> 01:12:24,219
Can I speak with you
in private ?

1764
01:12:24,261 --> 01:12:25,679
Sure.

1765
01:12:25,721 --> 01:12:27,014
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1766
01:12:27,097 --> 01:12:29,266
What's on
your mind, son ?

1767
01:12:30,893 --> 01:12:32,853
I want Ray
off the team, Coach.

1768
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:36,148
You know my policy,
Gerry.

1769
01:12:36,273 --> 01:12:37,566
Yes, I do,

1770
01:12:37,566 --> 01:12:38,692
and I respect it,

1771
01:12:38,817 --> 01:12:41,695
I know that Ray missed
that block on purpose.

1772
01:12:43,614 --> 01:12:45,574
Sometimes you just got
to cut a man loose.

1773
01:12:47,576 --> 01:12:49,203
Hmm.

1774
01:12:49,286 --> 01:12:51,121
Well,
you're the captain.

1775
01:12:52,289 --> 01:12:53,749
You make a decision,

1776
01:12:53,874 --> 01:12:56,460
but you support
your decision.

1777
01:12:56,543 --> 01:12:59,296
We're going to
remember this for a long time.

1778
01:12:59,296 --> 01:13:00,422
Hey, guys, wait up.

1779
01:13:00,464 --> 01:13:03,008
I want to catch
a ride with you.

1780
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:04,009
Ray ?

1781
01:13:06,136 --> 01:13:08,305
Oh, man,
not a word.

1782
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:09,306
You're out.

1783
01:13:09,431 --> 01:13:11,141
What ?

1784
01:13:11,183 --> 01:13:13,769
I'm not going to let you
play for this team anymore.

1785
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:19,233
Oh, yeah, Jerry Lewis ?

1786
01:13:19,316 --> 01:13:20,359
Going to go
and tell ''Coach Coon''

1787
01:13:20,484 --> 01:13:23,445
what to do
just like last time ?

1788
01:13:23,487 --> 01:13:25,489
But, then, that's right.

1789
01:13:25,614 --> 01:13:28,617
He is your daddy now,
isn't he ?

1790
01:13:28,617 --> 01:13:30,494
Boone don't cut anybody.

1791
01:13:30,494 --> 01:13:31,620
Remember, Gerry ?

1792
01:13:33,372 --> 01:13:34,790
I had you cut, Ray.

1793
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:38,085
You're willing
to just throw away

1794
01:13:38,168 --> 01:13:39,920
our friendship for them ?

1795
01:13:41,755 --> 01:13:43,882
You can keep them.

1796
01:13:57,271 --> 01:13:58,856
Hi.

1797
01:13:58,939 --> 01:14:01,525
!! Now, I've been happy lately !!

1798
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:04,695

the good things to come !!

1799
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:07,823

01:14:07,865 --> 01:14:10,367

01:14:10,409 --> 01:14:12,536
!! Oh, I've been
smilin' lately !!

1802
01:14:12,661 --> 01:14:14,538
O-Officer ?

1803
01:14:16,582 --> 01:14:19,376
Heck of a game you boys
played last night.

1804
01:14:20,794 --> 01:14:21,962
Thanks.

1805
01:14:22,004 --> 01:14:23,672
Thank you, Officer.

1806
01:14:23,672 --> 01:14:26,091
Best defense I've seen
in 20 years.

1807
01:14:26,133 --> 01:14:27,718
!! Peace train !!

1808
01:14:27,843 --> 01:14:28,719
Tell that coach of yours

1809
01:14:28,844 --> 01:14:31,096
to keep up the good work.

1810
01:14:31,138 --> 01:14:33,682
Oh. Oh, yeah.
I'll--I'll do that.

1811
01:14:33,724 --> 01:14:36,685
!! Now, I've been
smilin' lately !!

1812
01:14:36,727 --> 01:14:39,855
!! Thinkin' about
the good things to come !!

1813
01:14:39,897 --> 01:14:42,149
!! And I believe
it could be !!

1814
01:14:42,191 --> 01:14:44,151
Yo, man,
your taxi had a siren.

1815
01:14:44,193 --> 01:14:45,569
Superman !

1816
01:14:45,694 --> 01:14:47,279
Hey, man,
what's going on ?

1817
01:14:47,321 --> 01:14:48,864
Doing all right.

1818
01:14:48,864 --> 01:14:51,450
!! Ride on the peace train !!

1819
01:14:51,575 --> 01:14:54,745
!! Hoo-ah-eeh-ah-hoo-ah !!

1820
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:57,206
!! Come on the peace train !!

1821
01:14:57,289 --> 01:15:00,834
!! Just come on
the peace train !!

1822
01:15:00,876 --> 01:15:02,586
!! Yes,
it's the peace train !!

1823
01:15:02,628 --> 01:15:04,713
Ohh !

1824
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,433
This song goes out

1825
01:15:16,475 --> 01:15:17,643
to the undefeated Titans.

1826
01:15:17,768 --> 01:15:19,645
This city is alive
with school spirit.

1827
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:21,772
Go get 'em, Titans !
Whoo !

1828
01:15:21,855 --> 01:15:24,942
!! Saturday night
I was downtown !!

1829
01:15:25,025 --> 01:15:28,779
!! Workin' for the FBI !!

1830
01:15:28,904 --> 01:15:31,907
!! Sittin' in a nest
of bad men !!

1831
01:15:31,907 --> 01:15:36,495
!! Whiskey bottles
piling high !!

1832
01:15:36,537 --> 01:15:40,791
!! A pair of.45s
made me open my eyes !!

1833
01:15:40,874 --> 01:15:45,379
!! My temper just started
to rise !!

1834
01:15:45,504 --> 01:15:49,216
!! She was along cool woman
in a black dress !!

1835
01:15:49,258 --> 01:15:53,095
!! Just-a5'9 ',
beautiful, tall !!

1836
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:56,265
!! With just one look
I was a bad mess !!

1837
01:15:56,348 --> 01:16:01,770
!! 'Cause that long cool woman
had it all !!

1838
01:16:07,818 --> 01:16:08,986
!! Whoo !!!

1839
01:16:13,574 --> 01:16:14,950
!! Had it all !!

1840
01:16:17,536 --> 01:16:19,830
!! Ooh !!

1841
01:16:19,872 --> 01:16:21,290
We are
here tonight to honor men

1842
01:16:21,373 --> 01:16:23,542
that are teaching
our young people

1843
01:16:23,584 --> 01:16:25,961
leadership on and off
the field

1844
01:16:26,003 --> 01:16:27,838
and high moral standards
as well.

1845
01:16:27,838 --> 01:16:29,506
Ladies and gentlemen,

1846
01:16:29,548 --> 01:16:33,802
let me introduce to you
the 1971 Hall of Fame nominees.

1847
01:16:35,846 --> 01:16:38,015
Come on, Daddy.

1848
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:39,558
Whoo !

1849
01:16:41,727 --> 01:16:42,811
When we played Jefferson,

1850
01:16:42,853 --> 01:16:45,189
we were down by 4
with 1 0 seconds left.

1851
01:16:45,272 --> 01:16:47,149
So we blitzed the safety
from the weak side  ...

1852
01:16:47,191 --> 01:16:48,901
Wow.

1853
01:16:48,984 --> 01:16:52,154
Heck of a season
the Titans are having, Coach.

1854
01:16:52,196 --> 01:16:53,864
Too bad it's got to end.

1855
01:16:53,906 --> 01:16:56,533
Oh, we're still in it,
Lyle.

1856
01:16:56,575 --> 01:16:57,743
Taber's boys
are pretty good,

1857
01:16:57,868 --> 01:16:59,995
but I think we'll take
em in the regional.

1858
01:17:00,037 --> 01:17:02,998
Well, not if we have anything
to say about it.

1859
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,751
You just leave this
to us, Bill.

1860
01:17:05,834 --> 01:17:10,172
Boone's out, and you're
head coach again.

1861
01:17:10,172 --> 01:17:13,300
And all roads lead
to the Hall of Fame.

1862
01:17:13,467 --> 01:17:14,426
Coach Taber ?

1863
01:17:14,468 --> 01:17:15,886
What do you think
of the Titans, Coach ?

1864
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:17,221
Think you have a chance
against that defense

1865
01:17:17,304 --> 01:17:18,847
they have over there
at T.C. ?

1866
01:17:20,182 --> 01:17:22,226
Ton, Billy, Ray,
come on over here.

1867
01:17:22,309 --> 01:17:25,771
Boys. These are
my all-American tackles.

1868
01:17:25,854 --> 01:17:27,314
Prize bulls
who don't do nothin'

1869
01:17:27,356 --> 01:17:29,358
but knock the chocolate
out of folks.

1870
01:17:29,483 --> 01:17:31,360
Is it true
you're not gonna trade films

1871
01:17:31,443 --> 01:17:32,611
with Coach Boone ?

1872
01:17:32,653 --> 01:17:35,614
I'm not gonna do anything
to help that monkey.

1873
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:39,535
Well  ...

1874
01:17:39,618 --> 01:17:42,746
what are we going
to do about this ?

1875
01:17:42,788 --> 01:17:45,499
We're gonna get ready
for Saturday.

1876
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:47,167
See you out there
on the field.

1877
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:50,921
Hut !

1878
01:17:57,511 --> 01:17:58,929
Hey, Mr. Official.

1879
01:17:58,929 --> 01:18:01,223
Mr. Official, can I talk
to you for a second ?

1880
01:18:01,265 --> 01:18:03,392
Back off, Coach, if you
want to stay in this game.

1881
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:06,061
Hut !

1882
01:18:09,857 --> 01:18:11,942
I've got holding
on 78 white.

1883
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:14,695
Are you trying to cheat
my boys out of the game ?

1884
01:18:14,778 --> 01:18:15,946
1 5 more yards.

1885
01:18:15,988 --> 01:18:18,240
Let 'em play,
Ref, let 'em play.

1886
01:18:18,365 --> 01:18:20,409
Let 'em play !
Let the boys play !

1887
01:18:20,534 --> 01:18:21,410
Cheater !

1888
01:18:21,535 --> 01:18:22,411
Coach, come on.

1889
01:18:22,536 --> 01:18:23,495
Cheater !

1890
01:18:23,537 --> 01:18:24,705
Coach.

1891
01:18:31,962 --> 01:18:33,130
Go, go, go, go !

1892
01:18:38,135 --> 01:18:40,679
Oh, come on !
What was that ?!

1893
01:18:40,721 --> 01:18:42,431
Uhh !

1894
01:18:42,514 --> 01:18:44,266
What are you, blind ?

1895
01:18:44,266 --> 01:18:45,684
That wasn't a hold.

1896
01:18:45,726 --> 01:18:48,604
Oh, come on, that was
such a bad call.

1897
01:18:52,149 --> 01:18:53,275
Titus !

1898
01:18:57,029 --> 01:18:59,615
Give him
apiece of your mind !

1899
01:19:04,453 --> 01:19:05,913
I know all about it,
Titus.

1900
01:19:05,996 --> 01:19:07,581
What are you
talking about, Bill ?

1901
01:19:07,623 --> 01:19:08,916
You call this game fair,

1902
01:19:08,999 --> 01:19:11,293
or I'll go
to the papers.

1903
01:19:11,335 --> 01:19:13,921
I don't care
if I go down with ya,

1904
01:19:14,004 --> 01:19:16,632
but before God,
I swear I'll see

1905
01:19:16,757 --> 01:19:19,301
every last one of you
thrown in jail.

1906
01:19:19,426 --> 01:19:20,844
You dig your own grave.

1907
01:19:20,886 --> 01:19:22,888
OK.

1908
01:19:23,013 --> 01:19:24,598
Defense ! On me !

1909
01:19:24,723 --> 01:19:27,893
OK, Petey, don't you drift
to the strong side.

1910
01:19:27,935 --> 01:19:29,895
Coach, they're callin' a holding
penalty on me every time.

1911
01:19:29,937 --> 01:19:31,355
Did I ask
for your excuses ?

1912
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,315
You want to act
like a star,

1913
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,483
you better give me
a star effort,

1914
01:19:34,608 --> 01:19:36,193
Do you hear me ?

1915
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,488
Forget about him !

1916
01:19:39,613 --> 01:19:42,157
Alan, you're in !

1917
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:43,492
Come on !

1918
01:19:43,492 --> 01:19:45,536
All right, now,

1919
01:19:45,619 --> 01:19:48,622
I don't want them
to gain another yard.

1920
01:19:48,747 --> 01:19:51,333
ou blitz all night !

1921
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:52,668
If they cross
the line of scrimmage,

1922
01:19:52,793 --> 01:19:54,628
I'm gonna take
every last one of you out.

1923
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:56,338
You make sure  ...

1924
01:19:56,463 --> 01:19:59,758
they remember forever

1925
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,802
the night they played
the Titans.

1926
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:06,473
Leave no doubt !

1927
01:20:08,767 --> 01:20:09,852
Set !

1928
01:20:09,935 --> 01:20:11,812
Come on, y'all !
Swing it left !

1929
01:20:11,854 --> 01:20:13,689
All right ! All right !
All right !

01:20:13,772 --> 01:20:15,649
Set ! Hut !

1931
01:20:23,407 --> 01:20:26,785
You better make yourself
comfortable down there.

1932
01:20:26,827 --> 01:20:27,828
Real comfortable.

1933
01:20:55,564 --> 01:20:57,191
You did good !

1934
01:20:57,274 --> 01:20:59,193
That one was
for you, Coach.

1935
01:20:59,276 --> 01:21:00,861
All right, baby.
All right.

1936
01:21:00,903 --> 01:21:03,113
You brought us here,
Coach.

1937
01:21:03,155 --> 01:21:04,698
Run it up, Herman !

1938
01:21:04,823 --> 01:21:06,575
Leave no doubt !

1939
01:21:06,617 --> 01:21:09,703
!! Music's in your city, too !!

1940
01:21:09,745 --> 01:21:12,039
Set ! Hut !

1941
01:21:12,122 --> 01:21:14,541
!! Music's gettin' good to me !!

1942
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:17,044
!! But now, don't ya,
I said don't ya !!

1943
01:21:17,127 --> 01:21:19,630
!! Don't you want
to get higher ?!!

1944
01:21:19,755 --> 01:21:20,756
Hut hut !

1945
01:21:20,756 --> 01:21:22,132
!! Yeah !!

1946
01:21:22,174 --> 01:21:24,009
!! Don't you want
to get higher ?!!

1947
01:21:24,134 --> 01:21:28,514
!! Baby, baby,
let me light your fire !!

1948
01:21:28,597 --> 01:21:32,643
!! Oohha,
little bit higher !!

1949
01:21:32,768 --> 01:21:34,228
Good game.

1950
01:21:34,311 --> 01:21:35,312
Good game.

1951
01:21:35,312 --> 01:21:36,355
Yeah.

1952
01:21:38,315 --> 01:21:39,650
Good game.

1953
01:21:39,775 --> 01:21:41,610
Coach. Coach.

1954
01:21:42,861 --> 01:21:44,947
I took a straw poll.

1955
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:48,784
You just lost your self
the Hall of Fame.

1956
01:21:55,499 --> 01:21:57,251
Good game, y' all.

1957
01:21:57,334 --> 01:21:59,086
Hey, good job, 43.

1958
01:21:59,169 --> 01:22:00,796
Good job.
Good job, men.

1959
01:22:00,796 --> 01:22:02,339
Good job.
Hey, way to stick.

1960
01:22:02,464 --> 01:22:03,924
Good job.

1961
01:22:03,966 --> 01:22:05,259
Good game, Coach.

1962
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:10,222
Coach.

1963
01:22:28,991 --> 01:22:30,492
Yeah !

1964
01:22:31,535 --> 01:22:33,203
Titans !

1965
01:22:33,245 --> 01:22:35,539
Yeah !

1966
01:22:35,539 --> 01:22:36,665
Petey !

1967
01:22:36,707 --> 01:22:38,208
What happened
out there, man ?

1968
01:22:37,332 --> 01:22:39,418
Come on,
talk to me, Petey.

1969
01:22:40,836 --> 01:22:41,795
Petey !

1970
01:22:41,837 --> 01:22:43,964
I'm so proud of you.

1971
01:22:44,006 --> 01:22:45,549
Hey, Julius.

1972
01:22:45,674 --> 01:22:46,800
Julius.

1973
01:22:46,842 --> 01:22:48,093
Come here, man.

1974
01:22:48,135 --> 01:22:49,094
Don't move.

1975
01:22:49,136 --> 01:22:50,095
Go on.
It's OK.

1976
01:22:50,137 --> 01:22:51,430
- Man.
- What's up, man ?

1977
01:22:51,513 --> 01:22:53,098
Let's get out of here.

1978
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:54,725
Let's go paint the town
or something.

1979
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:55,726
Let's go. Let's go.

1980
01:22:55,851 --> 01:22:57,186
I--I got to hang
with my girl tonight.

1981
01:22:57,269 --> 01:22:58,312
I got to hang
with her tonight.

1982
01:22:58,437 --> 01:22:59,688
All right, all right.

1983
01:22:59,688 --> 01:23:01,023
Where you going ?

1984
01:23:01,106 --> 01:23:02,191
I don't know.

1985
01:23:02,274 --> 01:23:05,152
I--I don't know,
but I'm gonna go. All right ?

1986
01:23:05,194 --> 01:23:06,320
- You gonna go ?
- Yeah, man.

1987
01:23:06,403 --> 01:23:08,697
I want to go, man, but you
know what I mean, man.

1988
01:23:08,822 --> 01:23:09,740
I know.
I'll see ya.

1989
01:23:22,294 --> 01:23:24,296
Looks like
you weren't the one

1990
01:23:24,338 --> 01:23:26,215
with the mixed-up
priorities, huh ?

1991
01:23:26,298 --> 01:23:27,883
Emma  ...

1992
01:23:27,883 --> 01:23:30,594
I think it's gonna
take me a little longer

1993
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:32,513
than you might like.

1994
01:23:32,596 --> 01:23:33,722
But, um  ...

1995
01:23:35,224 --> 01:23:39,019
I just wanted you to know
that I'm gonna try.

1996
01:23:43,023 --> 01:23:44,441
Good-bye, Gerry.

1997
01:23:47,319 --> 01:23:48,737
Emma ?

1998
01:23:48,779 --> 01:23:50,864
Make me a promise ?

1999
01:23:50,906 --> 01:23:53,200
You'll be there
to root for us

2000
01:23:53,242 --> 01:23:55,369
when we play Marshall
for the title ?

2001
01:24:01,792 --> 01:24:03,961
!! Just yesterday mornin' !!

2002
01:24:04,086 --> 01:24:06,755
I know how much
it meant to you.

2003
01:24:08,382 --> 01:24:11,093
I ain't gonna lie.

2004
01:24:11,218 --> 01:24:13,804
I wanted the Hall
of Fame real bad.

2005
01:24:13,846 --> 01:24:16,765
Just plain old jealousy.

2006
01:24:16,807 --> 01:24:18,934
As old as Cain and Abel.

2007
01:24:18,934 --> 01:24:20,269
You know what ?

2008
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:23,230
I wanted it, too.

2009
01:24:23,272 --> 01:24:26,525
But there's always next year
or the year after that.

2010
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:28,944
As long as it takes
for them to wise up.

2011
01:24:28,986 --> 01:24:31,989
Wouldn't want it now
anyway.

2012
01:24:32,114 --> 01:24:34,116
Bunch of ol' rednecks.

2013
01:24:34,116 --> 01:24:36,660
!! That I thought
would never end !!

2014
01:24:38,412 --> 01:24:39,955
!! I've seen lonely times !!

2015
01:24:39,997 --> 01:24:42,958
Let's knock 'em dead
at state, Coach.

2016
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:43,959
Daddy !

2017
01:24:44,084 --> 01:24:44,960
Daddy !

2018
01:24:45,085 --> 01:24:45,961
Daddy !

2019
01:24:46,086 --> 01:24:48,672
Daddy ! You're home !

2020
01:24:48,714 --> 01:24:50,132
My girls ! Mmm-ah !

2021
01:24:50,174 --> 01:24:52,301
Give me a kiss.
Mmm-ah !

2022
01:24:52,426 --> 01:24:53,969
Congratulations, Herman.

2023
01:24:54,011 --> 01:24:55,262
All right. Mmm.

2024
01:24:55,304 --> 01:24:56,847
What'd I tell you,
baby, huh ?

2025
01:24:56,972 --> 01:24:59,391
Yeah, we can't get too
far ahead of ourselves.

2026
01:24:59,433 --> 01:25:02,561
We still got to get
Ed Henry and Marshall.

2027
01:25:02,603 --> 01:25:03,854
We got all these  ...

2028
01:25:03,979 --> 01:25:05,981
You've done a good job,
Coach Boone !

2029
01:25:05,981 --> 01:25:06,982
Congratulations !

2030
01:25:08,442 --> 01:25:09,693
!! My body's achin' !!

2031
01:25:09,818 --> 01:25:12,696
!! And my time is at hand !!

2032
01:25:14,531 --> 01:25:15,866
!! I won't make it
any other way !!

2033
01:25:15,866 --> 01:25:19,161
Well, I'll be
John Brown.

2034
01:25:19,161 --> 01:25:20,704
We cleaned up
the kitchen, Daddy,

2035
01:25:20,829 --> 01:25:23,749
so you could get
right to work.

2036
01:25:23,874 --> 01:25:24,833
You did ?

2037
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:26,877
Well,
I got news for you.

2038
01:25:26,877 --> 01:25:28,170
I ain't workin' tonight.

2039
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:29,296
Tonight,
we're gonna celebrate.

2040
01:25:29,338 --> 01:25:30,756
We're gonna
let these people know

2041
01:25:30,881 --> 01:25:31,840
who's gonna win state.

2042
01:25:31,882 --> 01:25:32,883
- Right ?
- Right !

2043
01:25:32,883 --> 01:25:33,884
- Right ?!
- Right !

2044
01:25:33,884 --> 01:25:34,885
- Right ?!
- Right !

2045
01:25:34,885 --> 01:25:35,886
- Right ?!
- Right !

2046
01:25:35,928 --> 01:25:37,179
Everybody !

2047
01:25:37,221 --> 01:25:38,847
We're gonna win state !

2048
01:25:38,889 --> 01:25:43,727
!! But I always thought
that I'd see you again !!

2049
01:25:43,769 --> 01:25:45,604
We're gonna win state !

2050
01:25:45,646 --> 01:25:49,608
!! Oh, I've seen fire,
and I've seen rain !!

2051
01:25:51,026 --> 01:25:52,528
!! I've seen sunny days !!

2052
01:25:52,611 --> 01:25:55,614
!! That I thought
would never end !!

2053
01:25:57,324 --> 01:25:58,784
!! I've seen lonely times !!

2054
01:25:58,909 --> 01:26:01,912
!! When I could not
find a friend !!

2055
01:26:03,497 --> 01:26:06,041
!! But I always thought
that I'd see you !!

2056
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:07,209
Hey, Gerry !
You man !

2057
01:26:07,209 --> 01:26:08,335
No, you !
No, you, you !

2058
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:10,754
You ! Yeah !

2059
01:26:12,673 --> 01:26:16,927
!! Thought I'd see you
one more time again !!

2060
01:26:19,555 --> 01:26:22,474
Oh, shoot ! Gerry !
Are you OK ?

2061
01:26:44,997 --> 01:26:46,957
How you doin', son ?

2062
01:26:46,999 --> 01:26:48,500
He ain't all right ?
He all right ?

2063
01:26:48,542 --> 01:26:49,585
He's, uh  ...

2064
01:26:49,668 --> 01:26:50,878
How's he doing ?

2065
01:26:53,422 --> 01:26:56,425
Not too good.
Not too good.

2066
01:26:56,425 --> 01:26:58,093
How well is he doing ?

2067
01:26:58,135 --> 01:27:00,262
How bad is it ?

2068
01:27:00,304 --> 01:27:01,805
How bad is it ?

2069
01:27:01,847 --> 01:27:04,850
He's paralyzed
from the waist down.

2070
01:27:04,892 --> 01:27:08,437
Don't say that to me.
Don't say that to me.

2071
01:27:13,025 --> 01:27:14,526
Sorry, Mrs. Bertier.

2072
01:27:15,694 --> 01:27:19,281
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2073
01:27:20,699 --> 01:27:23,577
He doesn't want to see
anybody but you, Julius.

2074
01:27:23,619 --> 01:27:24,995
Yes, ma'am.

2075
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,705
You be strong.

2076
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:28,040
Yes, ma'am.

2077
01:27:28,165 --> 01:27:32,169
Those tears are not gonna
make my boy walk again.

2078
01:27:42,638 --> 01:27:44,306
Only kin's allowed in here.

2079
01:27:44,431 --> 01:27:47,851
Alice, are you blind ?

2080
01:27:47,893 --> 01:27:51,188
Don't you see
the family resemblance ?

2081
01:27:51,313 --> 01:27:53,190
That's my brother.

2082
01:27:55,526 --> 01:27:57,027
All right.

2083
01:28:10,499 --> 01:28:12,167
Oh, man.

2084
01:28:12,209 --> 01:28:14,503
Well, you think
I look banged up,

2085
01:28:14,503 --> 01:28:16,338
you should see my Camaro.

2086
01:28:16,463 --> 01:28:21,343
Man, I sure
am sorry, man.

2087
01:28:21,385 --> 01:28:23,971
I should have
been there with you.

2088
01:28:24,054 --> 01:28:27,391
What are you
talking about ?

2089
01:28:27,516 --> 01:28:29,977
You would've been in that bed
right next to me.

2090
01:28:30,102 --> 01:28:32,771
You can't be hurt
like this.

2091
01:28:34,857 --> 01:28:37,943
You--you're Superman.

2092
01:28:44,825 --> 01:28:46,660
I was afraid of you,
Julius.

2093
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:53,208
I only saw
what I was afraid of.

2094
01:28:53,292 --> 01:28:56,795
And now I know I was
only hating my brother.

2095
01:28:59,548 --> 01:29:01,675
I'll tell you what,
though.

2096
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,261
Um, when all this
is over  ...

2097
01:29:04,303 --> 01:29:06,805
me and you are
gonna move out

2098
01:29:06,847 --> 01:29:08,390
to the same
neighborhood together.

2099
01:29:08,432 --> 01:29:12,269
OK ? And, um  ...

2100
01:29:12,311 --> 01:29:16,023
and we'll get old,
and we'll get fat.

2101
01:29:16,106 --> 01:29:18,025
And there ain't gonna be
all this black-white

2102
01:29:18,108 --> 01:29:19,109
between us.

2103
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:27,409
Left side.

2104
01:29:29,286 --> 01:29:31,288
Strong side.

2105
01:29:38,337 --> 01:29:39,588
Good morning.

2106
01:29:39,630 --> 01:29:40,756
Good morning.

2107
01:29:42,424 --> 01:29:45,219
Uh, the Marshall fi lm.

2108
01:29:45,302 --> 01:29:46,595
Well, that's good.

2109
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:47,888
We're gonna have
to be real sharp

2110
01:29:48,013 --> 01:29:50,933
on the offensive
and defensive sides

2111
01:29:51,016 --> 01:29:52,226
of the football.

2112
01:29:52,309 --> 01:29:53,769
Figure we give
the kids

2113
01:29:53,769 --> 01:29:55,312
a couple of extra
practices this week,

2114
01:29:55,312 --> 01:29:56,855
make sure
they stay focused.

2115
01:29:56,897 --> 01:30:00,150
Got a press conference
today at 1 2 noon.

2116
01:30:00,192 --> 01:30:02,486
Press conference ?

2117
01:30:02,611 --> 01:30:05,864
Listen, what we do here
amongst ourselves is one thing,

2118
01:30:05,906 --> 01:30:08,033
but we are not gonna
parade around

2119
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:09,785
talking about football
at a time like this.

2120
01:30:09,785 --> 01:30:11,245
Hold on. I'm not talking
about parading.

2121
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:13,247
I'm talking about
going out there,

2122
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:15,165
presentin' a strong,
united front.

2123
01:30:15,207 --> 01:30:17,251
Now, I'm hurtin'  ...

2124
01:30:17,334 --> 01:30:19,169
just like you are,
Yoast,

2125
01:30:19,211 --> 01:30:21,964
but the season
is not over yet.

2126
01:30:22,089 --> 01:30:24,800
I did--We did not
come this far

2127
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,219
to just break down
and lose now.

2128
01:30:27,261 --> 01:30:30,639
Everything's not always
about winning and losing.

2129
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:32,641
I'm a winner.

2130
01:30:34,226 --> 01:30:36,270
I'm going to win.

2131
01:30:36,353 --> 01:30:39,648
Is this even about
football anymore ?

2132
01:30:39,773 --> 01:30:41,817
Or is it just about you ?

2133
01:30:42,985 --> 01:30:44,653
Coach Boone  ...

2134
01:30:44,695 --> 01:30:47,239
Uh, Coach,
you lost Bertier  ...

2135
01:30:47,281 --> 01:30:48,866
Is your defense
in trouble ?

2136
01:30:48,949 --> 01:30:51,410
You cannot replace
a Gerry Bertier  ...

2137
01:30:53,829 --> 01:30:56,290
as a player or person.

2138
01:31:01,378 --> 01:31:02,838
I don't know, Mama.

2139
01:31:07,384 --> 01:31:08,677
Maybe Yoast was right.

2140
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:10,679
Maybe I pushed 'em
too hard.

2141
01:31:10,721 --> 01:31:12,848
Gerry had an accident.

2142
01:31:14,683 --> 01:31:16,852
Sometimes life's
just hard.

2143
01:31:18,145 --> 01:31:19,897
For no reason at all.

2144
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,691
You think I was blinded
by my own ambition ?

2145
01:31:22,691 --> 01:31:27,446
Mm. Whatever kind
of ambition it took

2146
01:31:27,571 --> 01:31:30,282
to do what you did
around here  ...

2147
01:31:30,324 --> 01:31:32,993
this world could use
a lot more of it, Herman.

2148
01:31:33,118 --> 01:31:34,536
Hmm.

2149
01:31:45,005 --> 01:31:46,465
Hey, Coach.

2150
01:31:46,507 --> 01:31:47,591
Hey, Coach.

2151
01:31:47,633 --> 01:31:48,884
ow you doing ?

2152
01:31:55,182 --> 01:31:56,934
This for me ?

2153
01:31:57,017 --> 01:32:00,437
I want you to be my eyes
out there, all right ?

2154
01:32:02,314 --> 01:32:03,774
Any of these guys slack off,

2155
01:32:03,899 --> 01:32:05,734
you just let me know.

2156
01:32:05,776 --> 01:32:07,486
You bet I will.

2157
01:32:09,238 --> 01:32:11,657
How you doing, Gerry ?

2158
01:32:11,782 --> 01:32:13,367
I'm all right, Coach.

2159
01:32:13,492 --> 01:32:14,952
I was just talking
to these guys about Marshall,

2160
01:32:15,035 --> 01:32:16,078
trying to get 'em  ...

2161
01:32:16,203 --> 01:32:18,455
You don't need to talk
about football now.

2162
01:32:18,497 --> 01:32:20,916
I think this is a good
time for refection

2163
01:32:20,916 --> 01:32:22,084
and for prayer  ...

2164
01:32:22,084 --> 01:32:23,627
Coach  ...

2165
01:32:23,752 --> 01:32:25,504
I'm hurt.

2166
01:32:25,629 --> 01:32:26,755
I ain't dead.

2167
01:32:26,797 --> 01:32:29,216
No, you're not.

2168
01:32:29,258 --> 01:32:30,968
No, you're not.

2169
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:34,972
You know, I've been,
uh, reading up

2170
01:32:35,097 --> 01:32:37,474
on the activities
that they got for people

2171
01:32:37,516 --> 01:32:39,810
in wheelchairs and such.

2172
01:32:39,935 --> 01:32:42,813
They got Olympics.

2173
01:32:45,816 --> 01:32:47,109
This is the granddaddy

2174
01:32:47,109 --> 01:32:49,778
of state high school football
championships.

2175
01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:51,655
The Virginia triple 'A. ''

2176
01:32:51,655 --> 01:32:54,658
It just doesn't get any better.

2177
01:32:54,658 --> 01:32:56,535
We have
Coach Herman Boone's Titans

2178
01:32:56,577 --> 01:32:58,787
vs. the legend, Ed Henry,

2179
01:32:58,829 --> 01:33:02,833
with over250 wins
in 30years.

2180
01:33:03,834 --> 01:33:04,835
Amen.

2181
01:33:04,835 --> 01:33:05,836
Amen.

2182
01:33:05,836 --> 01:33:06,879
Let's go !

2183
01:33:12,509 --> 01:33:14,303
Lastik,
what's the matter ?

2184
01:33:14,386 --> 01:33:17,264
I'm eligible.

2185
01:33:18,849 --> 01:33:20,976
Well, um, I'm glad
to hear that, son,

2186
01:33:20,976 --> 01:33:22,394
but I'm already married.

2187
01:33:22,436 --> 01:33:26,398
I got a C-plus average,
Coach.

2188
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:28,400
I'm going to college.

2189
01:33:28,442 --> 01:33:31,987
All right, fantastic.

2190
01:33:32,029 --> 01:33:33,989
Coach ? Coach ?

2191
01:33:33,989 --> 01:33:36,158
I just want
to say I'm sorry.

2192
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:38,702
You abandoned your team
in their moment of need, Petey.

2193
01:33:38,702 --> 01:33:39,703
'Sorry'' won't make up
for that.

2194
01:33:39,745 --> 01:33:40,996
Yeah, I know, but  ...

2195
01:33:41,038 --> 01:33:43,040
listen, I want
to play for you.

2196
01:33:43,165 --> 01:33:44,917
I want to play
for the championship.

2197
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,543
You can play for me
next year.

2198
01:33:46,585 --> 01:33:47,878
You sit on that bench.

2199
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:49,880
Show me you can support
your teammates.

2200
01:33:50,005 --> 01:33:51,882
You'll start again
as a senior.

2201
01:34:00,015 --> 01:34:01,183
Entering the stadium now

2202
01:34:01,225 --> 01:34:03,477
is Jean Bertier.
Now, she's the mother

2203
01:34:03,519 --> 01:34:06,939
of injured all-American
linebacker, Gerry Bertier.

2204
01:34:07,022 --> 01:34:08,607
And the Titan fans

2205
01:34:08,732 --> 01:34:10,943
are really giving her
a warm reception.

2206
01:34:17,032 --> 01:34:19,952
Gerry ! Gerry ! Gerry !

2207
01:34:20,035 --> 01:34:22,913
Gerry ! Gerry ! Gerry !

2208
01:34:23,038 --> 01:34:26,250
Gerry ! Gerry ! Gerry !

2209
01:34:26,333 --> 01:34:29,044
Gerry ! Gerry ! Gerry !

2210
01:34:29,086 --> 01:34:32,089
Gerry ! Gerry ! Gerry !

2211
01:34:32,214 --> 01:34:35,175
Gerry ! Gerry ! Gerry !

2212
01:34:35,217 --> 01:34:37,511
Gerry ! Gerry ! Gerry !

2213
01:34:37,553 --> 01:34:39,054
And here come
the Titans,

2214
01:34:39,096 --> 01:34:40,472
entering the stadium

2215
01:34:40,514 --> 01:34:42,766
in what's become
their own unique style.

2216
01:34:42,808 --> 01:34:44,977
! We feel,
hoo, hah, real good !

2217
01:34:45,102 --> 01:34:47,187
! Hoo, hah, we feel !

2218
01:34:47,229 --> 01:34:48,981
! Hoo, hah, real good !

2219
01:34:49,106 --> 01:34:50,691
! Hoo, hah, we feel !

2220
01:34:50,816 --> 01:34:52,568
! Hoo, hah, real good !

2221
01:34:52,651 --> 01:34:54,403
! Hoo, hah, we feel !

2222
01:34:54,528 --> 01:34:56,113
! Hoo, hah, real good !

2223
01:34:56,196 --> 01:34:58,115
! Hoo, hah, we feel !

2224
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:00,117
! Hoo, hah, real good !

2225
01:35:06,665 --> 01:35:08,542
Julius Campbell ?

2226
01:35:10,669 --> 01:35:12,546
Hi, I'm Emma Hoyt.

2227
01:35:12,588 --> 01:35:15,716
Oh. Oh, I guess
we never met, huh ?

2228
01:35:15,841 --> 01:35:17,593
Uh, excuse me, young lady.
You can't be here right now.

2229
01:35:17,676 --> 01:35:20,262
ou gonna have
to get back to your seat.

2230
01:35:22,598 --> 01:35:23,724
Well, now we've met.

2231
01:35:25,309 --> 01:35:27,436
Yeah.
It's nice to meet you.

2232
01:35:27,519 --> 01:35:29,104
Good luck, Julius.

2233
01:35:29,146 --> 01:35:30,272
2 ! 21 !

2234
01:35:30,314 --> 01:35:31,273
Whoa ! Wait !

2235
01:35:31,398 --> 01:35:32,608
What the hell's going on ?

2236
01:35:32,691 --> 01:35:33,734
Shotgun.

2237
01:35:33,817 --> 01:35:35,277
Who do they
think they are,

2238
01:35:35,319 --> 01:35:36,445
the New York Jets ?

2239
01:35:36,528 --> 01:35:37,446
Switch ! Switch !

2240
01:35:37,529 --> 01:35:38,530
Get 9 !

2241
01:35:38,572 --> 01:35:41,158
Get9 !
Bosley, move !

2242
01:35:41,283 --> 01:35:44,453
Move it up ! Line up !
Get Bosley ! Get9 ! Get9 !

2243
01:35:46,163 --> 01:35:47,456
All right, let's go !

2244
01:35:47,539 --> 01:35:48,540
Hut hut !

2245
01:35:53,879 --> 01:35:54,922
Real good.

2246
01:35:55,005 --> 01:35:56,173
Keep it up.
Shotgun rush.

2247
01:35:56,298 --> 01:35:59,468
Cover3 !
Go to cover3 ! Pass !

2248
01:35:59,593 --> 01:36:00,886
Hut !

2249
01:36:10,646 --> 01:36:12,022
Put some pressure
on that QB.

2250
01:36:12,022 --> 01:36:13,440
They got all day
to throw, Coach.

2251
01:36:13,482 --> 01:36:15,025
You just worry
about your offense.

2252
01:36:17,319 --> 01:36:19,488
Let's go !
Swing it ! Swing it !

2253
01:36:19,655 --> 01:36:20,614
Set !

2254
01:36:20,656 --> 01:36:21,615
Get set ! Get set !

2255
01:36:21,657 --> 01:36:23,367
Hut !

2256
01:36:26,495 --> 01:36:27,496
Yeah !

2257
01:36:29,498 --> 01:36:31,458
No !

2258
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:32,751
What's wrong, Gerry ?

2259
01:36:32,793 --> 01:36:35,254
Do not come in here !

2260
01:36:37,214 --> 01:36:38,340
They got receivers
everywhere out there.

2261
01:36:38,465 --> 01:36:40,217
It's like watching
Monday Night Football.

2262
01:36:40,342 --> 01:36:42,219
Good hustle, good hustle,
good hustle.

2263
01:36:42,219 --> 01:36:44,096
Just give him
a little cushion.

2264
01:36:44,221 --> 01:36:45,806
And when they throw
that ball, you stick him.

2265
01:36:45,848 --> 01:36:46,932
- Ready ?
- Break !

2266
01:36:49,518 --> 01:36:50,978
Ready ?!

2267
01:36:51,103 --> 01:36:53,230
Red, 57 !

2268
01:36:53,355 --> 01:36:54,565
Red, 57 !

2269
01:36:54,648 --> 01:36:57,401
Hut ! Hut hut !

2270
01:37:02,781 --> 01:37:04,116
Titans star quarterback,

2271
01:37:04,241 --> 01:37:07,703
Ronnie Bass, gains 6yards.

2272
01:37:07,828 --> 01:37:09,580
What you think ? You
think we got a chance ?

2273
01:37:09,663 --> 01:37:11,123
Got to give me some way
to disguise that coverage.

2274
01:37:11,248 --> 01:37:12,541
Let's start thinking
about it. Let's go.

2275
01:37:12,583 --> 01:37:13,959
Ready !

2276
01:37:14,084 --> 01:37:15,961
Set !

2277
01:37:16,003 --> 01:37:16,962
Hut !

2278
01:37:26,972 --> 01:37:28,849
They're a mile
ahead of us.

2279
01:37:28,891 --> 01:37:30,100
He's a mile ahead
of you, Coach.

2280
01:37:30,142 --> 01:37:31,435
If your defense
would stop somebody,

2281
01:37:31,518 --> 01:37:33,145
we'd get the ball
a little more.

2282
01:37:33,187 --> 01:37:34,563
Well, the Titans
gave 'em a scare,

2283
01:37:34,688 --> 01:37:37,524
but Ed Henry looks
supremely confident.

2284
01:37:37,566 --> 01:37:39,985
T. C. Williams
goes in at the half

2285
01:37:40,027 --> 01:37:41,695
trailing 7-0.

2286
01:37:41,737 --> 01:37:43,280
Coach !

2287
01:37:43,405 --> 01:37:44,448
Sweetheart.

2288
01:37:44,531 --> 01:37:45,574
You better get back
to your seat.

2289
01:37:45,574 --> 01:37:47,284
I can't, Coach.
What ?

2290
01:37:47,409 --> 01:37:49,536
Ed Henry's got Boone's
number, sure as shoot in'.

2291
01:37:49,578 --> 01:37:53,332
And you ain't doin' nothin'
against that shotgun.

2292
01:37:53,457 --> 01:37:54,583
Look, Coach  ...

2293
01:37:54,708 --> 01:37:57,336
now ain't the time
to be proud.

2294
01:37:57,461 --> 01:37:59,755
It's all right.
We're in a fight.

2295
01:38:00,881 --> 01:38:03,467
You boys are doing
all that you can do.

2296
01:38:03,509 --> 01:38:04,927
Anybody can see that.

2297
01:38:06,345 --> 01:38:09,598
Win or lose  ...

2298
01:38:09,598 --> 01:38:11,475
we gonna walk out
of this stadium tonight

2299
01:38:11,475 --> 01:38:13,060
with our heads held high.

2300
01:38:15,187 --> 01:38:16,647
Do your best.

2301
01:38:16,772 --> 01:38:18,774
That's all anybody
can ask for.

2302
01:38:18,899 --> 01:38:20,150
No, it ain't, Coach.

2303
01:38:20,192 --> 01:38:24,071
With all due respect, uh,
you demanded more of us.

2304
01:38:24,154 --> 01:38:26,490
You demanded perfection.

2305
01:38:26,615 --> 01:38:30,244
Now, I ain't saying that
I'm perfect, 'cause I'm not.

2306
01:38:30,327 --> 01:38:32,913
And I ain't gonna never be.
None of us are.

2307
01:38:33,038 --> 01:38:37,251
But we have won every single
game we have played till now.

2308
01:38:37,334 --> 01:38:40,504
So this team is perfect.

2309
01:38:40,546 --> 01:38:43,841
We stepped out on that field
that way tonight.

2310
01:38:43,924 --> 01:38:46,927
And, uh, if it's all the same
to you, Coach Boone,

2311
01:38:46,969 --> 01:38:48,971
that's how
we want to leave it.

2312
01:38:49,096 --> 01:38:50,389
Yeah.

2313
01:38:50,514 --> 01:38:53,475
I hope you boys have learned
as much from me this year

2314
01:38:53,517 --> 01:38:55,686
as I've learned from you.

2315
01:38:55,811 --> 01:38:59,106
You've taught this city how
to trust the soul of a man

2316
01:38:59,189 --> 01:39:00,983
rather than the look of him.

2317
01:39:01,108 --> 01:39:04,361
And I guess it's about time
I joined the club.

2318
01:39:04,403 --> 01:39:07,239
Herman ! I sure could
use your help.

2319
01:39:07,364 --> 01:39:09,533
Ed Henry's kicking my ass
out there.

2320
01:39:09,658 --> 01:39:12,119
Listen up.
This is our time now.

2321
01:39:12,244 --> 01:39:14,121
Second half is our time !

2322
01:39:14,204 --> 01:39:15,664
We gonna make some changes
on defense.

2323
01:39:15,789 --> 01:39:17,291
They're spreading us out
too far.

2324
01:39:17,374 --> 01:39:21,545
We gonna put Sunshine, Alan,
Glascoe, Davis.

2325
01:39:21,670 --> 01:39:24,173
You gonna play both ways,
rest of the game.

2326
01:39:24,256 --> 01:39:25,507
I don't want a receiver

2327
01:39:25,549 --> 01:39:27,259
to get across that line
of scrimmage.

2328
01:39:27,384 --> 01:39:29,678
Coach Yoast will tell you
where you're playing, all right ?

2329
01:39:29,678 --> 01:39:31,263
Let's go. It's our time.
Everybody in.

2330
01:39:31,388 --> 01:39:33,432
Our time ! Our time !
Our time !

2331
01:39:33,515 --> 01:39:35,559
Titans on 3 ! 1 , 2, 3 !

2332
01:39:35,684 --> 01:39:36,602
Titans !

2333
01:39:36,685 --> 01:39:39,146
Let's go ! Let's go !
Let's go !

2334
01:39:39,188 --> 01:39:40,397
All right, Julius.

2335
01:39:40,439 --> 01:39:41,857
We're gonna go 52 monster.

2336
01:39:41,899 --> 01:39:43,567
I know that's all
you need to know.

2337
01:39:43,692 --> 01:39:45,277
All right, we're going
zone, Alan. I need  ...

2338
01:39:45,402 --> 01:39:46,445
Sir, I could play
with Roosevelt.

2339
01:39:46,528 --> 01:39:48,572
But I cannot play
with these guys.

2340
01:39:48,697 --> 01:39:50,199
No, I tell you what.

2341
01:39:50,282 --> 01:39:51,909
I didn't warm the bench
all year

2342
01:39:51,992 --> 01:39:53,827
so I could watch us
go down on my account.

2343
01:39:53,869 --> 01:39:56,997
Put Petey in.
He's better.

2344
01:39:57,122 --> 01:39:59,416
You want him
to take your spot,

2345
01:39:59,458 --> 01:40:01,418
you go give it to him.

2346
01:40:02,878 --> 01:40:04,004
Thank you.

2347
01:40:12,763 --> 01:40:14,765
Ha ha !
Ha ha ha !

2348
01:40:18,894 --> 01:40:19,895
All right, Petey !

2349
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:21,855
All right !
That was beautiful !

2350
01:40:23,482 --> 01:40:25,317
Offense, let's go.

2351
01:40:25,359 --> 01:40:26,944
!! There's a place up ahead !!

2352
01:40:27,027 --> 01:40:28,362
!! And I'm goin' !!

2353
01:40:28,445 --> 01:40:31,615
!! Justas fast as my feet
can fly !!

2354
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:35,202
!! Come away, come away
if you're goin' !!

2355
01:40:35,244 --> 01:40:38,747
!! Leave the sinkin' ship
behind !!

2356
01:40:38,789 --> 01:40:42,251
!! Come on the risin' wind !!

2357
01:40:42,334 --> 01:40:44,211
!! We're goin' up
around the bend !!

2358
01:40:44,253 --> 01:40:46,547
All right, Defense ?
Get out there !

2359
01:40:46,630 --> 01:40:47,840
Let's go ! Let's stop 'em !

2360
01:40:47,923 --> 01:40:50,509
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

2361
01:40:50,551 --> 01:40:55,556
!! Better get while
the gettin's good !!

2362
01:40:55,639 --> 01:40:59,101
!! Hitch a ride to the end
of the highway !!

2363
01:40:59,184 --> 01:41:00,519
!! Where the neons
turn to wood !!

2364
01:41:00,561 --> 01:41:02,813
O-2...inside veer.
O-2 inside veer.

2365
01:41:02,855 --> 01:41:05,983
!! Come on the risin' wind !!

2366
01:41:06,108 --> 01:41:09,528
!! We're goin' up
around the bend !!

2367
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:11,655
!! Ooh !!

2368
01:41:11,780 --> 01:41:15,951
!! You can ponder
perpetual motion !!

2369
01:41:15,993 --> 01:41:19,121
A field goal
attempt for T. C. Williams.

2370
01:41:19,246 --> 01:41:20,664
It's good !

2371
01:41:20,664 --> 01:41:23,375
!! Always time
for a good conversation !!

2372
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:26,545
So they trail
Marshall 7-3,

2373
01:41:26,670 --> 01:41:28,088
heading into
the fourth quarter.

2374
01:41:28,130 --> 01:41:29,965
Ref. He's lining
up off sides !

2375
01:41:29,965 --> 01:41:31,425
Look, 48's off sides !

2376
01:41:31,508 --> 01:41:33,010
Freeze right, 99 Z go.

2377
01:41:33,135 --> 01:41:34,678
Ref, I know you can see him !
You got eyes !

2378
01:41:34,803 --> 01:41:37,014
Gun-right, 84, X-fat.

2379
01:41:37,139 --> 01:41:39,516
And tell Tommy to watch
the free safety. Go.

2380
01:41:39,558 --> 01:41:41,185
Get right in there, Blue.
You know what I'm talking about.

2381
01:41:41,268 --> 01:41:43,103
You can't be afraid.

2382
01:41:43,145 --> 01:41:46,607
He's off sides !
He's lining up off sides !

2383
01:41:46,690 --> 01:41:48,442
Got to hold them here,
Defense !

2384
01:41:48,525 --> 01:41:49,568
Hold 'em right here !

2385
01:41:49,610 --> 01:41:51,904
Whoa ! Pass ! Pass !

2386
01:41:51,987 --> 01:41:54,448
Let's go, Offense.
Let's go.

2387
01:41:58,577 --> 01:42:01,580
Titans trail Marshall 7-3.

2388
01:42:01,622 --> 01:42:02,998
All Marshall has to do

2389
01:42:02,998 --> 01:42:04,500
is hold on to the ball,

2390
01:42:04,583 --> 01:42:06,752
and they will be
the state champions.

2391
01:42:06,877 --> 01:42:08,462
Watch 'em
on the weak side !

2392
01:42:08,587 --> 01:42:10,339
On the weak side !

2393
01:42:23,769 --> 01:42:25,729
Hold on to that ball,
Petey !

2394
01:42:26,939 --> 01:42:28,774
Hold the ball !
Hold the ball !

2395
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:31,151
Whoa, whoa, whoa !
Hold on to that ball !

2396
01:42:31,193 --> 01:42:32,611
Hold on to that ball !

2397
01:42:32,653 --> 01:42:35,155
Hold on to that ball,
Petey !

2398
01:42:35,197 --> 01:42:37,533
All right ! All right !

2399
01:42:37,616 --> 01:42:39,660
Ohh, Petey !

2400
01:42:41,537 --> 01:42:42,371
Coach.

2401
01:42:42,496 --> 01:42:43,664
Get a time-out !
Time-out !

2402
01:42:43,747 --> 01:42:45,457
Coach, they're slanting to
our strong side every time.

2403
01:42:45,499 --> 01:42:46,500
You got to catch 'em
in that slant

2404
01:42:46,542 --> 01:42:47,543
and let 'em over pursue.

2405
01:42:47,626 --> 01:42:48,836
He's onto your game.

2406
01:42:48,919 --> 01:42:52,214
You got to throw something
at him he's not ready for.

2407
01:42:52,256 --> 01:42:55,092
- Rev ! Where's Rev ?
- Yes, sir.

2408
01:42:55,175 --> 01:42:57,094
- All right, listen, you ready to run ?
- Yes, sir.

2409
01:42:57,094 --> 01:42:59,680
Fake 23 blast  ...

2410
01:42:59,805 --> 01:43:01,473
with a backside
George reverse.

2411
01:43:01,515 --> 01:43:03,392
You got that ?
Fake 23 blast

2412
01:43:03,475 --> 01:43:04,810
with a backside
George reverse.

2413
01:43:04,852 --> 01:43:05,853
Like your life
depended upon it.

2414
01:43:05,936 --> 01:43:07,980
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go get 'em !

2415
01:43:08,105 --> 01:43:10,107
The Titans take the field

2416
01:43:10,190 --> 01:43:13,819
with time to run one final play
for the state championship.

2417
01:43:13,944 --> 01:43:15,946
I thought
he was injured.

2418
01:43:16,071 --> 01:43:17,406
I guess not.

2419
01:43:17,489 --> 01:43:19,408
Why are they
bringing in a QB. ?

2420
01:43:19,491 --> 01:43:20,951
The Titans have 75yards

2421
01:43:20,993 --> 01:43:22,244
to get to the end zone.

2422
01:43:22,286 --> 01:43:24,580
Oh, my gosh.
I can't watch this.

2423
01:43:24,663 --> 01:43:26,248
I can't watch this. No.

2424
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:27,791
What ? What ?
Sheryl, what's wrong ?

2425
01:43:27,833 --> 01:43:29,126
No, I can't watch it.

2426
01:43:29,168 --> 01:43:30,127
Sheryl !

2427
01:43:30,252 --> 01:43:32,588
No, it's too bad.
Not now. Not now.

2428
01:43:36,258 --> 01:43:38,594
They're gonna throw it deep.
Cover deep !

2429
01:43:38,677 --> 01:43:41,138
Watch
the deep pass ! Cover it deep !

2430
01:43:41,263 --> 01:43:44,016
Ready ! Set ! Hut !

2431
01:44:01,742 --> 01:44:02,826
Yeah !

2432
01:44:02,868 --> 01:44:05,454
Yeah ! Ha ha ha !

2433
01:44:25,599 --> 01:44:27,059
Well, that's it, boys.

2434
01:44:27,184 --> 01:44:28,227
That's it.

2435
01:44:28,310 --> 01:44:29,770
Good season.

2436
01:44:29,853 --> 01:44:30,896
It's all right.

2437
01:44:31,021 --> 01:44:33,023
Yes ! Yes !

2438
01:44:33,065 --> 01:44:34,191
Come on.

2439
01:44:38,237 --> 01:44:39,196
Congratulations, Coach.

2440
01:44:39,321 --> 01:44:40,489
All right.
Thank you, Coach.

2441
01:44:40,614 --> 01:44:41,782
You did a good job.
Played a fine game.

2442
01:44:43,242 --> 01:44:45,452
I know football,

2443
01:44:45,494 --> 01:44:47,538
but what you did
with those boys  ...

2444
01:44:47,621 --> 01:44:50,666
You were the right man
for the job, coach !

2445
01:44:50,791 --> 01:44:52,668
You're a Hall of Famer
in my book.

2446
01:44:57,506 --> 01:45:00,050
Yeah !

2447
01:45:01,218 --> 01:45:02,803
Mmm-ah ! Whoo !

2448
01:45:02,845 --> 01:45:04,388
Yeah !

2449
01:45:04,513 --> 01:45:05,973
Yeah !

2450
01:45:06,056 --> 01:45:07,391
Whoo !
Hoo hoo hoo !

2451
01:45:09,643 --> 01:45:11,395
Yeah !

2452
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:12,646
Whoo !

2453
01:45:15,232 --> 01:45:18,235
Aah ! Ha !

2454
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:21,697
The Titans
danced their way into history.

2455
01:45:21,822 --> 01:45:23,699
13and0,
the perfect season.

2456
01:45:23,782 --> 01:45:25,701
State champions
and first runner-up

2457
01:45:25,784 --> 01:45:27,953
for the national
championship.

2458
01:45:27,995 --> 01:45:29,872
Second-best high school team
in the country.

2459
01:45:29,955 --> 01:45:33,125
Gerry Bertier won a gold medal
for the shot put

2460
01:45:33,167 --> 01:45:34,668
in the wheel chair games.

2461
01:45:34,793 --> 01:45:36,962
Daddy coached him.

2462
01:45:37,004 --> 01:45:39,423
10years later,
Gerry died.

2463
01:45:39,548 --> 01:45:42,384
And that's what brought us
back here today.

2464
01:45:42,426 --> 01:45:46,305
Gerry is gone,
but his spirit lives on.

2465
01:45:46,430 --> 01:45:49,266
People say that it can't work,
black and white.

2466
01:45:49,391 --> 01:45:51,977
Well, here we make it work
every day.

2467
01:45:52,102 --> 01:45:54,438
We have our disagreements,
of course.

2468
01:45:54,521 --> 01:45:56,523
But before we reach
for hate,

2469
01:45:56,565 --> 01:46:00,027
always, always we remember
the Titans.

2470
01:46:01,570 --> 01:46:05,449
!! Hm hm hm hm !!

2471
01:46:05,532 --> 01:46:09,036
!! Hm hm hm hm !!

2472
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:12,706

2473
01:46:12,831 --> 01:46:16,460

2474
01:46:16,502 --> 01:46:20,589

2475
01:46:20,589 --> 01:46:23,634

2476
01:46:23,759 --> 01:46:27,721

2477
01:46:27,763 --> 01:46:31,141
! Good-bye !

2478
01:46:51,203 --> 01:46:53,330
!! Ain't no mountain high !!

2479
01:46:53,372 --> 01:46:55,249
!! Ain't no valley low !!

2480
01:46:55,332 --> 01:46:59,169
!! Ain't no river wide enough,
baby !!

2481
01:46:59,211 --> 01:47:01,213
!! If you need me,
call me !!

2482
01:47:01,338 --> 01:47:02,840
!! No matter
where you are !!

2483
01:47:02,923 --> 01:47:04,967
!! No matter how far !!

2484
01:47:05,092 --> 01:47:06,552
!! Don't worry, baby !!

2485
01:47:06,635 --> 01:47:08,262
!! Just call my name !!

2486
01:47:08,345 --> 01:47:10,514
!! I'll be there
in a hurry !!

2487
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:12,224
!! You don't have
to worry !!

2488
01:47:12,349 --> 01:47:13,642
!! 'Cause baby there !!

2489
01:47:13,642 --> 01:47:17,104
!! Ain't no mountain
high enough !!

2490
01:47:17,229 --> 01:47:20,941
!! Ain't no valley
low enough !!

2491
01:47:20,983 --> 01:47:24,403
!! Ain't no river
wide enough !!

2492
01:47:24,528 --> 01:47:27,281
!! To keep me from gettin'
to you, baby !!

2493
01:47:27,364 --> 01:47:28,866
!! Remember the day !!

2494
01:47:28,949 --> 01:47:30,492
!! I set you free !!

2495
01:47:30,534 --> 01:47:32,953
!! I told you
you could always !!

2496
01:47:32,995 --> 01:47:34,371
!! Count on me, darlin' !!

2497
01:47:34,413 --> 01:47:36,540
!! From that day on !!

2498
01:47:36,665 --> 01:47:38,250
!! I made a vow !!

2499
01:47:38,375 --> 01:47:40,085
!! I'll be there
when you want me !!

2500
01:47:40,127 --> 01:47:41,837
!! Some way, somehow !!

2501
01:47:41,962 --> 01:47:43,255
!! 'Cause baby there !!

2502
01:47:43,297 --> 01:47:46,884

2506
01:47:58,103 --> 01:48:01,440
!! Ain't no mountain
