{4199}{4225}Someone threw it at me.
{4272}{4296}And hit you?
{4320}{4339}No.
{4376}{4447}Didn't you see|anybody carry such rag?
{4720}{4790}I Ioathe cats. They're|trecherous Iike peopIe.
{5298}{5328}Is it a good fiIm, madam?
{5347}{5375}No, boring.
{5545}{5566}What about?
{5595}{5640}About Iove, but boring.

{8454}{8489}Mister Peter BaIicki...
{8531}{8558}inside, pIease.
{8721}{8758}Need a portrait?
{8790}{8820}How much is this one?
{8846}{8872}Two grand.
{8909}{8941}And how Iong does it take?
{8985}{9028}Don't pIay it wise, man.
{9065}{9204}This is no piece work.|You pay for my taIent.
{9239}{9274}Have you a taIent?
{9327}{9352}No.
{9379}{9422}Maybe you can make shoes?
{9478}{9521}Or grow trees?
{9572}{9668}Yeah. Trees I can.
{9747}{9783}So you're not Iost, man.
{10011}{10051}This way to CastIe Square?
{10052}{10090}Straight on.
{10382}{10411}Go on, pIease.
{10446}{10537}I am thinking not because|I don't know what to say,
{10549}{10624}but I've been asked this|question twice aIready.
{10647}{10708}When I enroIIed in university,|the answer was simpIe.
{10763}{10885}Four years Iater in the same buiIding
{10907}{10960}I was no Ionger so sure. And now...
{10999}{11124}The question is a good one:|Why do I want to be a Iawyer?
{11146}{11262}Do you want me to say what I feeI,|or what I shouId say?
{11281}{11340}We wouId Iike to know more about you.
{11353}{11440}The shortest answer is:|I don't know.
{11484}{11591}I find it attractive.
{11750}{11868}I've seen quite many|cases for the past four years.
{11894}{12133}You couId caII it a sociaI function|and peopIe need it.
{12150}{12309}But most of aII, if aII goes weII,|I wiII have the chance to meet
{12312}{12385}and understand peopIe|whom I couId not meet in|any other profession.
{12435}{12466}That is why I want to...
{12637}{12792}I beIieve that as years go by,|the answer become more eIusive.
{12816}{12909}Every man asks himseIf whether|what he does makes any sense.
{12945}{13040}There are more and more doubts.
{14219}{14256}DeIivery!
{14326}{14372}Beata! Hurry up.
{14444}{14473}Good morning.
{15809}{15890}Go away! You scare the pigeons!
{16032}{16064}Go away!
{16316}{16339}Bastard!
{17065}{17113}You free?
{17149}{17184}Can't you see?
{17189}{17255}Maybe we couId wait.|It's coId.
{19484}{19580}What's your view of the|generaI crime prevention?
{19608}{19751}GeneraIIy, it's the impact of|a punishment not on the convict,
{19753}{19824}but on others to|discourage them.
{19862}{19925}- More preciseIy...|- ExactIy.
{19956}{20026}It is the impact through|the convict.
{20031}{20124}Or even, it's the convict|which is the impact.
{20136}{20224}It is deterrence, simpIy, a scare.
{20230}{20301}ArticIe 50 of the penaI code.
{20310}{20366}I don't Iike your ironic tone.
{20371}{20394}The generaI crime prevention...
{20397}{20481}Its a questionabIe justification|of the severity of punishment.
{20525}{20563}Not onIy for me...|it is often unjust.
{20604}{20797}CouId you support it with|an authoritative cIassic opinion?
{20832}{20916}Never since Cain has|any punishment improved
{20921}{21013}or deterred the worId|from perpetrating crimes.
{21058}{21093}Am I to name the author?
{21093}{21124}No, thank you.
{21390}{21483}Mrs. you didn't|pay for the vegetabIes.
{21710}{21758}You need a Iift?
{22708}{22735}Mister!
{24327}{24367}A treat from my wife.
{24387}{24419}Want some?
{24624}{24673}Come on, take it!
{26314}{26339}HaIIo.
{26672}{26722}What can I do for you?
{26781}{26930}I have a picture here.
{27029}{27105}Can you enIarge it?
{27268}{27318}The cracks wiII show.
{27413}{27448}Never mind.
{27462}{27499}AII right.
{27578}{27614}Madam,
{27663}{27771}is it true that a photo can teII|if a person is aIive, or not?
{27785}{27839}Who toId you this crap?
{28220}{28241}How are you?
{28243}{28383}Fine. I want the finaI number|from you, as usuaI.
{28443}{28477}Seventeen.
{28491}{28516}I aIready got it.
{28552}{28579}Sixteen.
{28598}{28649}Sixteen? So cIose?
{28678}{28710}AIright, make it fifteen.
{28742}{28783}Fifteen.

{28995}{29081}How much did you rake in Iast month?
{29084}{29118}Four hundred and tweIve...

{29185}{29294}And forty-six Iast week.|You're breaking it even.
{29296}{29322}I am.

{40132}{40200}Your Iine of fortune|is Iong and strong...
{40288}{40317}...and two kids.
{40393}{40415}When?
{44033}{44083}There are moments in Iife when you|feeI that anything is possibIe,
{44126}{44178}that the way is open before you|and you can do what you Iike.
{44200}{44277}I feIt it after graduating|from high schooI.
{44279}{44459}I thought it wouId never repeat.|And now, again.
{44462}{44558}The feeIing when you have Ieft|an important time behind,
{44583}{44630}and now|aII is up to you aIone?
{44632}{44685}ExactIy.

{47962}{48033}Excuse me, you're|going to Mokotow?

{48301}{48347}Where did that guy want to go?
{48349}{48386}WoIa.
{48563}{48658}Take it easy, nervous man!
{49068}{49094}Is something wrong?
{49111}{49132}No.
{49149}{49227}I just think it may not be as simpIe.
{50661}{50703}CouId you roII up|the window a IittIe?
{50724}{50752}It's coId.
{51879}{51908}Turn Ieft now.

{51985}{52024}I prefer this end.
{52058}{52085}Okay.
{53478}{53533}PuII up. It's over there.
{53547}{53582}There is no road up there.

{66064}{66158}I want to be brave Iike him,

{68300}{68370}Come out.|I'II show you something.
{68387}{68419}ShaII I put on a jacket?
{68445}{68493}What for?
{68566}{68589}Is it far?
{68592}{68629}No. Get aboard.
{69054}{69160}You aIways wanted|to go somewhere.|Now, we can go anywhere.
{69278}{69370}You said that one of your customers,|a Iady, is a mountain waIker.
{69388}{69414}It's her husband.
{69467}{69609}Her husband.|We can go in the mountains.
{69653}{69736}We'II recIine the seats.|I aIso have a bIanket.

{69868}{69904}How did you get this car?
{70034}{70076}The case is cIosed.
{70620}{70680}Is it the end, sir?
{70903}{70926}The end.
{72471}{72621}It's me. I Iost. Yes, compIeteIy.
{72634}{72671}I don't know. I just don't know.
{72744}{72777}Maybe I'II take a waIk.
{72793}{72863}No, no, no. Don't come.
{72917}{73020}How are you?|SIept weII?
{73055}{73078}Good... Bye.
{73955}{73979}Mister!
{74036}{74059}Jack!
{75705}{75845}Excuse me, sir.|I know it's against the ruIe.
{75846}{75926}In fact, it is.
{75952}{75989}Now that it's aII over,
{75992}{76088}I wonder if a senior Iawyer...
{76108}{76143}somebody with a name...
{76146}{76273}wouId not make a difference?
{76275}{76312}None at aII.
{76417}{76540}Perhaps I shouId have|put it differentIy...
{76542}{76682}Your speech was, I think, the best|case against capitaI punishment|I have heard in many years.
{76684}{76740}And the sentence had|to be what it was.
{76866}{76944}You made no mistake|either as a Iawyer,
{76968}{77223}or as a man, in those|hard circumstances.
{77247}{77316}But I am gIad I've met you.
{77318}{77338}Good-bye.
{77341}{77490}Maybe you couId imagine|a better judge for this case.
{77514}{77644}What happened is my responsibiIity.|Don't you feeI better?
{77650}{77787}No. you see, maybe it is irreIevant,
{77789}{77918}but when this boy today|taIked how he had handIed|a cord first in a bar
{77919}{78033}in Karkowskie Przedmiescie|street, I had been there...
{78035}{78058}Where?
{78075}{78136}In that same bar, at the same time,|aImost one year ago.
{78159}{78259}On that day I passed the exam|to the Iawyer's profession.
{78277}{78424}If I was more carefuI then...
{78441}{78543}You're too sensitive.|It's not fit for this job.
{78572}{78607}Now it is too Iate...
{78619}{78780}Yes. Today, you have|aged a IittIe. Good-bye.
{78813}{78838}Good-bye.
{79926}{79973}The warden wiII see you|in a minute.
{81276}{81320}- How is Iife?|- Warm.
{85076}{85099}Good morning.
{85161}{85195}The screen isn't working.
{85293}{85319}CIean it up.
{85892}{85918}Come in!
{86109}{86145}Everything is ready, sir.
{86147}{86170}Thank you.
{86469}{86550}Get me number twenty-four.
{86601}{86633}Won't be a moment.
{86694}{86767}Thank you... I knew it.
{86770}{86810}So did I.
{86859}{86980}Yes, Mr. barrister,|you wiII have 30 minutes.
{87067}{87168}30 minutes, aII right.
{87187}{87212}Come in.
{87298}{87321}Reporting, sir!
{87340}{87381}Take the barrister to the prisoner.
{87436}{87481}May I Ieave my attache case here?
{87818}{87862}- Good morning, sir.|- Good morning.
{87985}{88068}I am seeing him.|He wants to taIk to me.
{88071}{88103}It's a burdensome duty.
{88128}{88227}It is. Mister Prosecutor,|it's my first time.
{88230}{88284}I wish it were your Iast, sir.
{88312}{88459}Maybe the moment is wrong,|but we hardIy see each other.
{88461}{88551}I want to congratuIate you on|the birth of your son, am I right?
{88554}{88682}Yes... recentIy... thank you.
{90106}{90139}You wanted to see me.
{90185}{90204}Yes.
{90287}{90376}Yes. Did you see my mother?
{90378}{90411}Yes.
{90453}{90479}Did she cry?
{90500}{90530}She did.
{90553}{90788}Did she want...|did she say anything?
{90839}{91049}No... she just cried.|Sit down.
{91199}{91480}CouId you see my mother|again, after this?
{91511}{91599}Of course I can, I can.
{91615}{91657}I thought you wouId,
{91689}{91800}because you caIIed out to me as|I waIked into the prison van.
{91834}{91870}You caIIed ''Jack''.
{91965}{92208}Yes, I caIIed out to you.|I wanted... I don't know what I wanted.
{92351}{92631}I am aImost twenty-one,|but when you caIIed out,|tears weIIed up in my eyes.
{92897}{92962}I said... in the court.
{92964}{93036}I did not Iisten,|untiI the moment you caIIed out.
{93061}{93283}AII of them, there...|and here, are against me.
{93310}{93368}Against what you had done.
{93370}{93402}It means the same.
{93586}{93668}You want me to see your mom.
{93737}{93904}Yes, to teII my mom to bury me|in one grave with my father.
{93990}{94063}I guess I can be buried|in a cemetery.
{94098}{94122}You can.
{94141}{94201}There was a priest here|and he said I couId.
{94204}{94229}You can.
{94302}{94392}WeII, in my father's grave,|there is stiII room for one.
{94409}{94541}My mother booked it for her...
{94544}{94715}but now teII her to Iet me have it.
{95548}{95646}Yes, sir.|Yes, sir.
{95934}{95982}The warden wants|to know if it's over?
{96041}{96072}Not yet.
{96241}{96269}Grave?
{96439}{96480}What do you mean?
{96502}{96577}You said there are|three pIaces in this grave.
{96604}{96864}Yes... there... my father,|IittIe Mary and one is vacant.
{96893}{96968}Mary is there for five years.
{97006}{97163}She was run over by|a tractor in our viIIage.
{97196}{97300}She was in the sixth grade.|She was tweIve.
{97302}{97621}Before that I and the trator|driver, my paI, had been|drinking wine and vodka.
{97637}{97823}Then he drove the tractor drunk|and ran over her.
{97836}{97945}It happened in|a meadow by the woods.
{98065}{98161}Here in my caII, I thought|that if she were aIive,
{98267}{98527}I wouId not have Ieft the viIIage|at aII. Maybe I wouId have stayed.
{98529}{98808}She was my sister.|I had three brothers, but she was|the onIy one, the onIy sister.
{98875}{99111}She was... she Ioved me|most and so did I.
{99178}{99235}Everything couId|have been different.
{99304}{99452}But afterwards I had to go away,|join a Iabour brigade.
{99512}{99639}I did not want to Ieave.
{99653}{99716}Maybe this wouId not have happened.
{99750}{99885}Maybe I wouId not have been here.
{100084}{100188}The warden and the prosecutor|want to know if it's over?
{100273}{100382}TeII mister prosecutor that|I shaII never say it's over.
{100386}{100430}Mr. barrister wiII|never say it's over.
{100432}{100459}Never.
{100576}{100723}We bought that grave, because|Mary Ioved trees, the greenery.
{100758}{100938}She was waIking to the woods|when it happened.
{101597}{101632}Have you the sentence?
{101836}{101878}I have everything.
{101901}{101923}Let's go.
{101967}{102003}You may Ieave your attache|case here, pIease.
{102374}{102407}Take the prisoner out.
{102409}{102444}Yes, sir.
